WHEN I was in America last year, delivering the Yale Lectures on Preaching, I preached "The "Four Men " on Sunday morning,
 April I2th.in the chapel of Yale University. Mr. D. L. Moody, the evangelist, who chanced to he present, insisted on its
 being printed, and he sent copies, I believe, to all the students of the University. In the same irresistible way, he got
 me to publish "Temptation " and "Conscience," which were given as talks to the students in his own institutions at
 Northfield. As these are circulating in America, I have thought they might be acceptable and useful in this country also.
 Of the other chapters, those on " Christ and the Wants of Humanity " and " Public Spirit" were delivered in the University
 Chapel, Glasgow, at the academic service, March 18th.1891, and March I3th 1892, respectively.<p>

The way in which this book has come together has precluded any attempt at systematic teaching. My sole endeavour has been 
to handle a few important themes of faith and conduct in a way that may be found instructive and readable by young men.<p>
