<BR><BR><BR>
<P><B>1.) It is a fact that God loves you...</B>
<P>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)
“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)
(See also...1 John 3:1, 1 John 4:16, John 14:21, Jeremiah 31:3)
<BR>
<BR>
<P><B>2.) But we're separated from God by our sin, and we all sin...</B>
<P>“ For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23)
“...because all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12)
(See also...Romans 3:12)
<BR>
<P><B>3.) And sin leads to death...</B>

<P>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)
“I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am He, you shall die in your sins.” (John 8:24) 
(See also...Romans 5:12, Romans 7:11, James 1:15-16, Revelation 20:11-15, Romans 8:6)

<P><B>4.) But Jesus died to pay the price for our sins...</B>

<P>“All the prophets testify about Him, that everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His Name.” (Acts 10:43)
“For Christ also died for sins, once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit.” (1 Peter 3:18)
(See also...Psalms 103:12, John 8:24, Romans 5:6-8, 1Corinthians 15:3)

<P><B>5.) Not even by our own works and good deeds can we pay that price…</B>

<P>“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as the result of works, that no one should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)
(See also...Romans 3:20, Romans 9:11, Romans 11:6)

<P><B>6.) But why do we need Jesus...?</B>

<P>“Jesus said to him, I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life, no one comes to the Father but through Me.” (John 14:6)
“And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other Name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)
(See also…Ephesians 2:8, Acts 16:31, 1Timothy 2:5)

<P><B>7.) So what must we do to be saved...?</B>

<P>“...if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved...” (Romans 10:9)
<P>“…you abide in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine, and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31-32)
(See also...Matthew 11:28-30, Acts 13:39, Romans 6:4, John 3:16, 1 Peter 3:18, Mark 16:16)

<P><B>8.) Count the cost...!</B>

<P>“Then Jesus said to His disciples, if anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.” (Matthew16:24)
(See also...Luke 14:27-28)

<P><B>9.) It’s an open, public commitment...!</B>

<P>“Everyone therefore who shall confess Me before men, I will also confess before My Father Who is in heaven.” (Matthew 10:32)
(See also…Romans 10:10)

<P><B>10.) We are saved and can know it, not just by feelings, but also by God’s word...</B>

<P>“These things I have written you who believe in the Name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life.” (1 John 5:13) 
“Now as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God...” (John 1:12)
(See also...1 John 3:24, John 6:37, John 5:24)

<P><B>11.) We are also commanded to study, pray, fellowship, go to church, take communion, be baptized and witness...!</B>

<P>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you...” (Matthew 28:19-20)
“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.” (2 Timothy 2:15)
(See also...Acts 2:42, Hebrews 10:23-25, Acts 1:8, Luke 22:16, 1 Peter 3:15)

<P><I>GIVE YOUR LIFE TO HIM NOW!</I>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="RED">Lord Jesus come into my life, I know I’m sinner and I need Your forgiveness, write my name in Your book of life and fill me with Your Holy Spirit, thank You for dying for me and rising from the dead and that I am born again, in Jesus Name I pray,
<BR>
<P>Amen.
