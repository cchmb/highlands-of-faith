<body>The florals and landscapes, with occasional cityscape and closeups of blossoms or a bee, are all in dazzling color, all handsomely set in thin black frames. Computer-enhanced digital works, they have a slightly misty, almost dreamlike quality that begs scrutiny. </P><P>A second look is automatic when you consider photographer Brian Heminger. You might have seen him before, in one of many places.</P><P>Maybe you've heard him eruditely discussing the Bible from the pulpit of the Calvary Chapel Outreach in Half Moon Bay. Or watched him expertly snip your hair at Main Street Hair Designs. Maybe you've tapped your toes as he's kept the beat in some Christian blues band.</P><P>"He's a pastor that not only leads his flock, he shears them, too," said Calvary Chapel congregation member Karen D'Amato.</P><P>Characteristically, Heminger doesn't dwell on his skills. He just attributes them to illustrating God's presence - and doing what he likes to do. </P><P>"It's a very, very busy life," he chuckled, sitting in La Di Da surrounded by his photos and morning-coffee sippers. </P><P>His La Di Da exhibit, "Moments," has been extended through February at the caf\'8e, at 500 Purissima. The photos, all on sale for &#036;175 each, are dazzling and arresting.</P><P>Their computer enhancements, that give the photos their dreamlike feel, was designed to make viewers stop and think, Heminger said.</P><P>Moments, he writes in his artist's statement, take different forms. </P><P>They can be observations: pinpoints in time in which you see something you hadn't noticed before. They can be new perspectives: lurking in every moment, when you see something in a different way. Or they can be fleeting things that make viewers realize they "need to slow down to make each moment count."</P><P>Heminger said he hopes his photos provide "an opportunity to look at common images in uncommon ways. It's reality, but just not quite.</P><P>"The key is, it's a different way to look at the world around us. The unfortunate part is, we're so doggone busy, we rarely take the time to see the world around us."</P><P>Photography lasted more than several moments for Heminger. Growing up in Claremont, Calif., he started it in high school, and, he says, "It stuck with me."</P><P>"I had no intentions. It was just compulsion," he said, that kept him snapping the shutter. </P><P>About five years ago, he discovered digital photography, to his delight. "You get to manipulate your own images," he said. "That's the beauty of it - I can do more on my computer than the darkroom could offer me."</P><P>Heminger uses a digital Nikon CoolPix 995 camera, and has gone through Photoshop 6, 7, and Elements 1 and 2, to create his photos. But it took a Bible verse to jolt him into seeing something special in them.</P><P>He had put the exhibit together "about 80 percent," and framed the images, but it all just hadn't jelled yet. "If the show was going to be in public, it's got to say something," he said. "It took awhile to define what I wanted to say."</P><P>Then, while reading the Bible, he happened upon Romans I:20, and the exhibit's purpose crystallized for him.</P><P>The verse reads, "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse."</P><P> In other words, Heminger explained, God's qualities are clearly visible from all that's around us.  </P><P>"There is so much more to see, and we just don't see it," he said. "God made himself evident, obviously. The question is, whether we see it or not."</P><P>Heminger is the pastor of the nondenominational Calvary Chapel Outreach, which has been in Half Moon Bay for two years. The church was founded by a man named Chuck Smith during the "Jesus movement" of the 1960s, Heminger explained, and took in the era's misfits and outcasts: disillusioned hippies, surfers, druggies and Boomers, all searching for meaning.</P><P>Today there are more than 800 Calvary Chapel Outreach churches in the United States, and 200 to 300 internationally, Heminger said. </P><P>"We're a fellowship of like-minded believers," he said. </P><P>What's unique about the church, he continued, is its close study of the Bible: verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book. The idea is that with such informed study, readers can make their own choices about their beliefs.</P><P>"You can make up your own mind instead of relying on someone else for what to believe," he said.</P><P>The critical issue, he went on, is the individual's relationship to God - not necessarily just the church. </P><P>"Distracted by the institution, judgments based on the institution are not only not fair, they are theologically wrong," he said.</P><P>He became a Christian 22 years ago and was involved in the church in Southern California, where he served as an assistant pastor.  He was ordained more than three years ago, about the time he said he felt God led him and his wife of 20 years, Carol, from their Claremont home to the Coastside. </P><P>"We believe the Lord sent us up here," he said.</P><P>Another longstanding thread in his life is his work as a hair stylist, and avocation playing the drums.</P><P>He has been cutting hair for about 25 years, he said, and that work has been as a Southern California salon owner, on national tours for a hair-care company, and finally to Main Street Hair Designs, where he rents a station. Carol works at Bay World Travel. </P><P>"The beauty of this work is, I can take it anywhere," he said.</P><P>He sees many of his hair-styling clientele in his church. "We want a good-looking congregation, too," he laughed.</P><P>He began with drums in childhood. His parents told him and his two siblings they expected each to learn a musical instrument. Then Heminger watched the Ed Sullivan introduce the Beatles to America - and his choice was made.</P><P>"I was sitting in front of the TV, my jaw hanging open, and (I thought,) 'That's what I want to do,'" he said, laughing. </P><P>His parents bought him a drum set and provided lessons, and today he plays in Christian blues bands.</P><P>All those activities, though, have not left him frazzled - not in the least, he said.</P><P>"There is an edge to my life that is a spiritual edge, and I wouldn't want it any other way," he said thoughfully.</P><P>"The only uncomfortable thing is the focus outside of my comfort zone," he said. "I think that's a tremendous thing. I don't think it's a good thing to always try to be comfortable."</P><P>All of the things he does, including the photography that he wants to see grow and continue, led to this point, he said.</P><P>"Maybe God prepared me for this time, this work. We are all the sum total of our experiences."</P><BR CLEAR=ALL>
