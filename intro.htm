INTRODUCTORY: THOMAS A KEMPIS' IMITATION OF CHRIST<p></center>

But Thomas A Kempis? -the name had come across her in her reading, and she felt the satisfaction, which everyone knows, 
of getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary in the memory, She took up the little old clumsy book with 
some curiosity: it had the corners turned down in many places, and some hand, now for ever quiet, had made at certain
 passages strong pen-and-ink marks, long since browned by time.  Maggie turned from leaf to leaf, and read where the
 quiet hand pointed . . . .<br>
A strange thrill of awe passed through her while she read, as if she had been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn 
music, telling of beings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor. . . . She knew nothing of doctrines and 
systems-of mysticism or quietism; but this voice out of the far-off middle ages was the direct communication of a human
 soul's belief and experience, and came to her as an unquestioned message.<br>
I suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned book, for which you need only pay sixpence at a bookstall, works
 miracles to this day, turning bitter waters into sweetness; while expensive sermons and treatises, newly issued, leave 
all things as they were before.   It was written down by a hand that waited for the heart's prompting; it is the chronicle
 of a solitary, hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and triumph -not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those
 who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones. And so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and human
 consolations.<p>
