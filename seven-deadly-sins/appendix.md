IMAGO CHRISTI. THE EXAMPLE OF JESUS CHRIST

Thirty-third Thousand. In Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s. Red line Edition.  Handsomely
bound in padded red roan, net, 7s. bd.

MR. SPURGEON says: -'This is a delightful book, upon a glorious subject, by one
who is better qualified to write it than any other man. With Mr. Stalker's
"Life of Christ" we were greatly pleased, and therefore we were prepared to
welcome anything from his pen upon a kindred subject. Our highest expectations
are exceeded: this is an immortal book.'

'The execution is full of ingenuity, and the book can be recommended as a
devout and thoughtful commentary on practical Christian life in many phases.
Mr. Stalker has broad sympathies and a watchful eye, and speaks in a tone that
will commend itself to all his readers.'- Saturday Review.

'Mr.  Stalker certainly proves that the subject is a fruitful one. He shows
that the activity of Christ was of a more varied kind than perhaps we are apt
to imagine.  He exhibits Him in the home, in the State, in society, as a
friend, as a worker, as a sufferer, as a philanthropist, as a controversialist,
as a man of feeling, and so on; and on all these subjects he has much that is
interesting and much that is instructive to say. - Scotsman.

THE CHRISTOLOGY OF JESUS:  
HIS TEACHING CONCERNING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS.

Second Edition. Crown 3vo. cloth, 6s.

'The subject handled in these lectures by Dr. Stalker is one of 
paramount importance and interest, and he has handled it not only with learning, 
but (which is rare) with judgment, steering his way with a fine critical and 
religious tact among the numberless ingenious theories that are so fully 
produced in Germany.'- Spectator.

'Readers of "Imago Christi" will be prepared 
for the charm of this new work. The same freshness of treatment, the same vigour 
of style, the same evangelic fervour that we are familiar with in all Dr. 
Stalker's writings appear here. He has the art of making theology-usually deemed 
the dullest of subjects for all but its professional students- interesting to 
the general reader. But, while the style and treatment are popular in the best 
sense of the term, there lies behind a careful study of the subject in the full 
light of modern criticism.'-Critical Review.

' This is a remarkable book dealing 
with the teaching of Jesus concerning Himself according lo the Synoptic Gospels. 
All the lectures are thoughtful, reverent, and interesting. . . . The book is a 
striking and valuable addition to our library of theological literature.'- 
Guardian.

THE TRIAL AND DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST.
A DEVOTIONAL HISTORY OF OUR LORD'S PASSION.

Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s. Fourth Edition, completing 10,000.

'The author has a thorough hold of the circumstances and their literature; his
style is admirable in its lucidity an simplicity--enriched several times by
felicitous images, as, for instance, on page ii-and his spiritual insight is
unerring. No intelligent person can read this book without understanding what
happened, and-which is more important-why such things happened, ...It is a
noble book.  -DR. JOHN WATSON in The British Weekly.

We may view the book as a series of plain spoken homilies on topic after topic
of the Passion, strikingly told, with a careful dwelling on details and with an
earnest telling appeal, on the lessons to be derived. There are some passages
of great beauty, as that which dwells on the Saviour's look at Peter after the
denial.'- Record.

'We have here an exquisitely beautiful picture of the sufferings and death of
our Blessed Lord.'- The Rock.

"Dr Stalkers treatment of the Seven Words from the Cross-calm, reverent, and
impressive-may be compared with the tempestuous but splendid eloquence of Pere
Didon's handling of the same theme in his recently published "Lent
Conferences," as an illustration of two widely contrasted but equally effective
styles of religious utterances. We hail Dr. Stalker's work as a noteworthy
contribution to what may be called the Bibliography of the Cross.'- Christian
World.

THE PREACHER AND HIS MODELS.

Second edition, completeing 8000. Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s

'This volume, like all for which we are indebted to the pen of Dr.  Stalker,
ought to be in the library of every Christian minister, and of all who are
preparing to be Christian ministers. Local preachers also would do well to
purchase and ponder it.'-Methodist Times.

'Dr. Stalker sets Isaiah and Paul before the preacher as models for his
imitation, and descants on this and kindred parts of ministerial work with much
force and earnestness, and at the same time with careful sobriety. He happily
avails himself of a considerable personal experience and a wide range of
reading, and treats his subject in an interesting as well as stimulating
manner. The volume is one of great excellence.'-Scotsman

'Nothing can surpass the strong common sense and the practical wisdom of Dr.
Stalker's discriminations in these discussions. Dr.  Stalker's lectures are
characterised by strong masculine good sense, large reading and observation, a
wise use of experience, and felicitous illustration.  Dr. Stalker has again
demonstrated the inexhaustibleness and perennial interest of the sacred
records. No lessons for preachers so wise, manifold, and urgent are elsewhere
to be found.'-Evangelical Magazine.

THE FOUR MEN.

Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6a Second Edition, completeing 10,000

'As a guide to self-knowledge his book ought to be in the hands of 
every young man who has not lost faith in religion, and has some aspiration to 
attain to the highest type of manhood. '-Christian.


'There is a manly and godly tone about the teaching of the book, which makes it
interesting. Easy to read and likely to be useful. Young men especially would
be sure to be captivated by it.'- Record. ' The subjects are such as attract
young men; and it need scarcely be said that they are treated in a lively,
lucid, and vigorous manner.'- Expositor.


'More thoughtful, suggestive addresses than the eight gathered in the compass
of this dainty volume it would be hard to find.'-Queen.
