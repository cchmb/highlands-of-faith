SEVEN DEADLY SINS

BY THE

REV. JAMES STALKER, D.D.

SECOND EDITION

LONDON  
HODDER AND STOUGHTON  
27 PATERNOSTER ROW  
1902

PREFACE

As the subject of this book may, by its novelty in Protestant religious
literature, attract the attention of preachers desirous of leading their flocks
to fresh fields and pastures new, it may be mentioned that its history, as a
theological topic, is given in ZOCKLER'S Das Lehrstuck von den Sieben
Hauptsunden, and that each of the seven sins is discussed with great acuteness
and comprehensiveness in AQUINAS' Summa (Secunda Secunda).

The order varies in different writers; I have adopted that of the scholastic
catchword SALIGIA, composed of the initial letters of the words Superbia,
Avaritia, Luxuria, Invidia, Gula, Ira, Accidia. 

JAMES STALKER.
