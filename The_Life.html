(Curators note: In the scanning and formatting of this book, certain details have been lost oweing in large part to the
 difference between book form and on-line form. No text has been altered, but a few items have been inserted to help 
navigate around the text, while trying to preserve the feel and layout of the original. This book can still be found 
in print, and to the best of my knowledge, it belongs to the public domain. If anyone knows different and can correct
 me, please contact me, Brian Heminger,<a href="mailto:cchmb@comcast.net">
