CHAPTER XIII.<p>


THE GROUPS ROUND THE CROSS<p>
</center>
In the last chapter we saw the Son of Man nailed to the cursed tree.
There He hung for hours, exposed, helpless, but conscious, looking out
on the sea of faces assembled to behold His end.  On the occasion of an
execution a crowd gathers outside our jails merely to see the black
flag run up which signals that the deed is done; and in the old days of
public executions such an event always attracted an enormous crowd.  No
doubt it was the same in Jerusalem.  When Jesus was put to death, it
was Passover time, and the city was filled with multitudes of
strangers, to whom any excitement was welcome.  Besides, the case of
Jesus had stirred both the capital and the entire country.[1]<p>

The sight which the crowd had come to see was, we now know, the
greatest ever witnessed in the universe.  Angels and archangels were
absorbed in it; millions of men and women are looking back to it to-day
and every day.  But what impressions did it make on those who saw it at
the time?  To ascertain this, let us look at three characteristic
groups near the cross, whose feelings were shared in varying degrees by
many around them.<p>

I.<p>

Look, first, at the group nearest the cross--that of the Roman soldiers.<p>

In the Roman army it seems to have been a rule that, when executions
were carried out by soldiers, the effects of the criminals fell as
perquisites to those who did the work.  Though many more soldiers were
probably present on this occasion, the actual details of fixing the
beam, handling the hammer and nails, hoisting the apparatus, and so
forth, in the case of Jesus, fell to a quaternion of them.  To these
four, therefore, belonged all that was on Him; and they could at once
proceed to divide the spoil, because in crucifixion the victim was
stripped before being affixed to the cross--a trait of revolting
shame.[2]  A large, loose upper garment, a head-dress perhaps, a girdle
and a pair of sandals, and, last of all, an under garment, such as
Galilean peasants were wont to wear, which was all of a piece and had
perhaps been knitted for Him by the loving fingers of His mother--these
articles became the booty of the soldiers.  They formed the entire
property which Jesus had to leave, and the four soldiers were His
heirs.  Yet this was He who bequeathed the vastest legacy that ever has
been left by any human being--a legacy ample enough to enrich the whole
world.  Only it was a spiritual legacy--of wisdom, of influence, of
example.<p>

The soldiers, their ghastly task over, sat down at the foot of the
cross to divide their booty.  They obtained from it not only profit but
amusement; for, after dividing the articles as well as they could, they
had to cast lots about the last, which they could not divide.  One of
them fetched some dice out of his pocket--gambling was a favourite
pastime of Roman soldiers--and they settled the difficulty by a game.
Look at them--chaffering, chattering, laughing; and, above their heads,
not a yard away, that Figure.  What a picture!  The Son of God atoning
for the sins of the world, whilst angels and glorified spirits crowd
the walls of the celestial city to look down at the spectacle; and,
within a yard of His sacred Person, the soldiers, in absolute apathy,
gambling for these poor shreds of clothing!  So much, and no more, did
they perceive of the stupendous drama they were within touch of.  For
it is not only necessary to have a great sight to make an impression;
quite as necessary is the seeing eye.  There are those to whom this
earth is sacred because Jesus Christ has trodden it; the sky is sacred
because it has bent above Him; history is sacred because His name is
inscribed on it; the daily tasks of life are all sacred because they
can be done in His name.  But are there not multitudes, even in
Christian lands, who live as if Christ had never lived, and to whom the
question has never occurred, What difference does it make to us that
Jesus died in this world of which we are inhabitants?<p>

II.<p>

Look now at a second group, much more numerous than the first,
consisting of the members of the Sanhedrim.<p>

After condemning Jesus in their own court, they had accompanied Him
through stage after stage of His civil trial, until at last they
secured His condemnation at the tribunal of Pilate.  When at last He
was handed over to the executioners, it might have been expected that
they would have been tired of the lengthy proceedings and glad to
escape from the scene.  But their passions had been thoroughly aroused,
and their thirst for revenge was so deep that they could not allow the
soldiers to do their own work, but, forgetful of dignity, accompanied
the crowd to the place of execution and stayed to glut their eyes with
the spectacle of their Victim's sufferings.  Even after He was lifted
up on the tree, they could not keep their tongues off Him or give Him
the dying man's privilege of peace; but, losing all sense of propriety,
they made insulting gestures and poured on Him insulting cries.
Naturally the crowd followed their example, till not only the soldiers
took it up, but even the thieves who were crucified with Him joined in.
So that the crowd under His eyes became a sea of scorn, whose angry
waves dashed up about His cross.<p>

The line taken was to recall all the great names which He had claimed,
or which had been applied to Him, and to contrast them with the
position in which He now was.  "The Son of God," "The Chosen of God,"
"The King of Israel," "The Christ," "The King of the Jews," "Thou that
destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days"--with these
epithets they pelted Him in every tone of mockery.  They challenged Him
to come down from the cross and they would believe Him.  This was their
most persistent cry--He had saved others, but Himself He could not
save.  They had always maintained that it was by the power of devils He
wrought His miracles; but these evil powers are dangerous to palter
with; they may lend their virtue for a time, but at last they appear to
demand their price; at the most critical moment they leave him who has
trusted them in the lurch.  This was what had happened to Jesus; now at
last the wizard's wand was broken and He could charm no more.<p>

As they thus poured out the gall which had long been accumulating in
their hearts, they did not notice that, in the multitude of their
words, they were using the very terms attributed in the twenty-second
Psalm to the enemies of the holy Sufferer: "He trusted in God; let Him
deliver Him now, if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of
God."  Cold-blooded historians have doubted whether they could have
made such a slip without noticing it; but, strange to say, there is an
exact modern parallel.  When one of the Swiss reformers was pleading
before the papal court, the president interrupted him with the very
words of Caiaphas to the Sanhedrim: "He hath spoken blasphemy: what
further need have we of witnesses?  What think ye?" and they all
answered, "He is worthy of death"; without noticing, till he reminded
them, that they were quoting Scripture.[3]<p>

Jesus might have answered the cries of His enemies; because to one
hanging on the cross it was possible not only to hear and see, but also
to speak.  However, He answered never a word--"when He was reviled, He
reviled not again," "as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He
opened not His mouth."  This was not, however, because He did not feel.
More painful than the nails which pierced His body were these missiles
of malice shot at His mind.  The human heart laid bare its basest and
blackest depths under His very eyes; and all its foul scum was poured
over Him.<p>

Was it a temptation to Him, one wonders, when so often from every side
the invitation was given Him to come down from the cross?  This was
substantially the same temptation as was addressed to Him at the
opening of His career, when Satan urged Him to cast Himself from the
pinnacle of the temple.  It had haunted Him in various forms all His
life through.  And now it assails Him once more at the crisis of His
fate.  They thought His patience was impotence and His silence a
confession of defeat.  Why should He not let His glory blaze forth and
confound them?  How easily He could have done it!  Yet no; He could
not.  They were quite right when they said, "He saved others, Himself
He cannot save."  Had He saved Himself, He would not have been the
Saviour.  Yet the power that kept Him on the cross was a far mightier
one than would have been necessary to leave it.  It was not by the
nails through His hands and feet that He was held, nor by the ropes
with which His arms were bound, nor by the soldiers watching Him; no,
but by invisible bands--by the cords of redeeming love and by the
constraint of a Divine design.<p>

Of this, however, His enemies had no inkling.  They were judging Him by
the most heathenish standard.  They had no idea of power but a material
one, or of glory but a selfish one.  The Saviour of their fancy was a
political deliverer, not One who could save from sin.  And to this day
Christ hears the cry from more sides than one, "Come down from the
cross, and we will believe Thee."  It comes from the spiritually
shallow, who have no sense of their own unworthiness or of the majesty
and the rights of a holy God.  They do not understand a theology of sin
and punishment, of atonement and redemption; and all the deep
significance of His death has to be taken out of Christianity before
they will believe it.  It comes, too, from the morally cowardly and the
worldly-minded, who desire a religion without the cross.  If
Christianity were only a creed to believe, or a worship in whose
celebration the aesthetic faculty might take delight, or a private path
by which a man might pilgrim to heaven unnoticed, they would be
delighted to believe it; but, because it means confessing Christ and
bearing His reproach, mingling with His despised people and supporting
His cause, they will have none of it.  None can honour the cross of
Christ who have not felt the humiliation of guilt and entered into the
secret of humility.<p>

III.<p>

Let our attention now be directed to a third group.  And again it is a
comparatively small one.<p>

As the eyes of Jesus wandered to and fro over the sea of faces upturned
to His own--faces charged with every form and degree of hatred and
contempt--was there no point on which they could linger with
satisfaction?  Yes, among the thorns there was one lily.  On the
outskirts of the crowd there stood a group of His acquaintances and of
the women who followed Him from Galilee and ministered unto Him.  Let
us enumerate their honoured names, as far as they have been
preserved--"Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses
[Transcriber's note: Joseph?], and the mother of Zebedee's children."<p>

Their position, "afar off," probably indicates that they were in a
state of fear.  It was not safe to be too closely identified with One
against whom the authorities cherished such implacable feelings; and
they may have been quite right not to make themselves too conspicuous.
Apart from the danger to which they might be exposed, they had a whole
tempest of trouble in their hearts.  As yet they knew not the
Scriptures that He must rise again from the dead; and this collapse of
the cause in which they had embarked their all for time and for
eternity was a bewildering calamity.  They had trusted that it had been
He who should have redeemed Israel, and that He would live and reign
over the redeemed race forever.  And there He was, perishing before
their eyes in defeat and shame.  Their faith was at the very last ebb.
Or say, rather, it survived only in the form of love.  Bewildered as
were their ideas, He had as firm a hold as ever on their hearts.  They
loved Him; they suffered with Him; they could have died for Him.<p>

May we not believe that the eyes of Jesus, as long as they were able to
see, turned often away from the brutal soldiers beneath His feet, and
from the sea of distorted faces, to this distant group?  In some
respects, indeed, their aspect might be more trying to Him than even
the hateful faces of His enemies; for sympathy will sometimes break
down a strong heart that is proof against opposition.  Yet this
neighbourly sympathy and womanly love must, on the whole, have been a
profound comfort and support.  He was sustained all through His
sufferings by the thought of the multitudes without number who would
benefit from what He was enduring; but here before His eyes was an
earnest of His reward; and in them He saw of the travail of His soul
and was satisfied.<p>

In these three groups, then, we see three predominant states of
mind--in the soldiers apathy, in the Sanhedrim antipathy, in the
Galileans sympathy.<p>

Has it ever occurred to you to ask in which group you would have been
had you been there?  This is a searching question.  Of course it is
easy now to say which were right and which were wrong.  It is always
easy to admire the heroes and the causes of bygone days; but it is
possible to do so and yet be apathetic or antipathetic to those of our
own.  Even the Roman soldiers at the foot of the cross admired Romulus
and Cincinnatus and Brutus, though they had no feeling for One at their
side greater than these.  The Jews who were mocking Christ admired
Moses and Samuel and Isaiah.  Christ is still bearing His cross through
the streets of the world, and is hanging exposed to contempt and
ill-treatment; and it is possible to admire the Christ of the Bible and
yet be persecuting and opposing the Christ of our own century.  The
Christ of to-day signifies the truth, the cause, the principles of
Christ, and the men and women in whom these are embodied.  We are
either helping or hindering those movements on which Christ has set His
heart; often, without being aware of it, men choose their sides and
plan and speak and act either for or against Christ.  This is the
Passion of our own day, the Golgotha of our own city.<p>

But it comes nearer than this.  The living Christ Himself is still in
the world: He comes to every door; His Spirit strives with every soul.
And He still meets with these three kinds of treatment--apathy,
antipathy, sympathy.  As a magnet, passing over a heap of objects,
causes those to move and spring out of the heap which are akin to
itself, so redeeming love, as revealed in Christ, passing over the
surface of mankind century after century, has the power so to move
human hearts to the very depths that, kindling with admiration and
desire, they spring up and attach themselves to Him.  This response may
be called faith, or love, or spirituality, or what you please; but it
is the very test and touchstone of eternity, for it is separating men
and women from the mass and making them one for ever with the life and
the love of God.<p>

[1] Keim strangely surmises that there was no great crowd; but this is
impossible.<p>

[2] As, however, the Jews would have objected to this, Edersheim
argues--but not convincingly--that there must have been at least a
slight covering.<p>
