<P>
Welcome to the Highlands of Faith, a Web site dedicated to the work of the Rev. James Stalker and a small group of other great preachers, most of them Scots. Since the Reformation, Scotland has produced some of the finest theologians and Bible expositors in the world. Many well known, others not so well known. James Stalker would be the latter. Also included is the work of the Rev. Alexander MacLaren. Men for their times, for sure, but to be noted for their rich exposition and love for God and His Word.<p>

One consideration to bear in mind while reading things here is the depth of intellect of these men. Multiple degrees and mastery over numerous languages, and yet, it seems clear to me, the willingness to subject that intellect to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. In the days we live in, it seems that many have rendered the power of the Gospel ineffectual in their own lives as their own intelligence carries them off on a path other than faith. Or the equal error of never exercising the command of Scripture to "love God(with) our mind"<p>
We need to seek that balance between devotion and intellect, or as James Stalker put it, "The preacher must be the master of many books, but the servant of only one."

There is no biography of the Rev. Stalker, but this site will attempt to outline some of the features of his life. As there is no biography, information has been drawn from a variety of sources, and some pretty obscure. But we will attempt to give the reader at least a glimpse into his life.<p> 

There would be no better way to do that than to read his work. One of the primary reasons for this web site is to make more people aware of the unique quality and character of his writings. For me, one of the most striking things about his work is the balance of great theology and devotional content. I have read a great many Pastors and Preachers that had great theology, but left me dry and cold. As well as others who were very devotional, but I was not challenged in my own faith to understand more. Rev. Stalker demonstrates what many have come to neglect these days, namely, an outstanding educational background, as well as a heart that burns for the Lord.<p> The devotional/theological balance is seen particularly in his books concerning the life of Jesus Christ. Starting with the book of that title, " The Life of Jesus Christ " (available at this site.) Plumb the depths of theology in " Imago Christi " (also available here.) One of the most important things to remember, when reading classics like these, is that we do not derive our theology from great men of the past; we derive our theology from the Word of God. The classics have much to offer us, but as with any broad spectrum of reading, we will encounter theology that may run counter to our own. Continue on though, there is much to be gleaned as long as we can rectify what we must from Scripture.<p>

Many people ask me how I discovered Rev. Stalker, as most, and almost all of his books are out of print. At a time in my life when I was examining my own heart about the call of God to the ministry, I was reading all I could find on the pulpit and the pastorate. I was drawn to "the old guys" because they were everything that I am not; well educated. My taste for the Scots had already been whetted by " Notes on the Pentateuch " by C.H. Mackintosh. On visiting my favorite supplier of used and out of print books, I came across Stalker's " The Preacher and His Models ". The title was fascinating and it was right up my theme alley. That book, probably more than any other, helped me define my calling. I was now hooked on Stalker. I bought everything I could find and had my friend search out anything he could find from the Rev. His bibliography is short, but rich. Click on the Bibliography/Biographical link to the left of this page!<p>

This site intends to have accessible as many of his complete books as possible, as well as any biographical information that we can dig up. Also included are misc. articles by or about Rev. Stalker. Sample for yourself the work of James Stalker and see if your own personal knowledge of and love for the Lord isn't encouraged and enhanced!<p>

One last thought on Rev. Stalker. I have been in contact with many sources in Scotland, including the Free Church, the Free Church College, as well as the Churches he Pastored and one thing is clear; there simply isn't that much about him. But what he left behind was an awful lot about HIM! Perhaps the legacy of Rev. Stalker is that he didn't leave much of a mark on this world, but what has remained, his books, have left a lasting impression of his love for his Lord. Or in the words of John the Baptist, " He must increase, but I must decrease"
Perhaps we would all do well to take heed to those words.

<p>" The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness. He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is the key to this treasure. "  Isaiah 33:5-6 (NIV)<p>
