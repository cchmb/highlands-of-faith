<b>James Stalker</b></font><font face="Arrus BT" Color="#0000aa"  size="3"><p> by Edgar DeWitt Jones, from his book, “The Royalty Of The Pulpit”</center><p>
<hr><p>
In our seminary days and first pastorates, ministers of my age will recall with what delight we welcomed certain books written by Dr. Stalker; for instance, his Life of Christ, Life of St. Paul, and especially, Imago Christi. The last-named book inspired many a sermon, revived lagging spirits, and made a host of young min­isters, and older ones too, grateful debtors to one of Scotland’s illustrious scholars and preachers.<p>

That journalistic connoisseur of preachers and preaching, Arthur Porritt, has left this tribute to the pulpit genius of Dr. Stalker:<p>

“Of all preachers I ever heard, Dr. James Stalker is the one whose sermons fasten themselves most indelibly on my mind. I can remember quite distinctly the whole argument of the sermon he preached when I first heard him nearly thirty years ago. And when he has set out his divisions they are fixed in his hearers’ minds. Take as an example his treatment of temptation. As regards temptation, all men, he says, are divisible into five groups, like Continental political parties. In the “center” are the tempted; on the “left center” the tempted who have fallen; on the “left” the tempted who have fallen and are tempt­ing others; on the “right center” are the tempted who have resisted their temptation; on the “right” are the tempted who have resisted temptation and are helping others to resist their temptations. We are all of us in one of the categories. Which? A sermon like that is quite unforgettable.”<p>

Dr. Stalker’s Yale lectures on The Preacher and His Models were delivered in 1891. Preceding him, in 1890, Dr. Adolphus J. F. Behrends spoke on The Philosophy of Preaching, and following him, Dr. Andrew M. Fairbairn, in 1892, lectured on The Place of Christ in Modern Theology. Not in the history of the Lecture­ship was there such a threesome of theologians, two being of the first magnitude.<p>

Dr. Stalker’s “Introductory” opened wide the door to the nature of the lectures which were to follow. This “Introductory” was also of the nature of a heart-to-heart talk with the divinity students, personal, warm, and friendly. Dr. Stalker was the second speaker imported from across the Atlantic, Dr. Dale having lectured at Yale in 1887. Of this fact Stalker took notice in a felicitous para­graph:<p>

“I warmly reciprocate the sentiments which have led the Faculty to come across the Atlantic the second time for a lecturer, and the liberality of mind with which they are wont to overstep the boundaries of their own denomination and select their lecturers from all the evangelical Churches. It is the first time I have set foot on your continent, but I have long entertained a warm admiration for the American people and a firm faith in their destiny; and I welcome an opportunity which may serve, in any degree, to demonstrate the unity which underlies the variety of our evangelical communions, and to show how great are the things in which we agree in comparison with those on which we differ.”<p>

In reference to fellow students in his own seminary days, Dr. Stalker instanced two men who gave little promise of ability and later won distinction in their pastorates. “Both,” he said, “had a spark of nature’s fire, and this is the possession which outshines all others when college is over and practical life begins.” A foot­note on the same page contains two stanzas of a poem by Robert Burns from which the phrase “spark of nature’s fire” occurs. The verses are so relevant to the subject it would be a pity to omit them:<p><center>
<table><i>
“A set o’ dull, conceited hashes<br> Confuse their brains in college classes,<br> They gang in stirks, and come out asses, <br>Plain truth to speak,<br> An’ syne they hope to speel Parnassus<br> By dint o’ Greek.<br>
Gi’e me a’e spark o’ nature’s fire,<br> That’s a’ the learnin’ I desire, <br>Then, though I trudge through dub an’ mire,<br> At pleuch or cart, <br>My muse, though homely in attire, <br>May touch the heart.”</table></i><p></center>
Speaking on “The Preacher as a Man of the Word,” Dr. Stalker said:<p>

“In the pulpit not only must a man have something to say, but it must be a message from God… He who receives the message of God now finds it in the Word of God…Hence one of the primary qualifications of the ministry is an intimate familiarity with the Scriptures…If I may give utterance to my own experience, I have never come to the end of a close study of a book of Scripture in the congregation, without having both a fresh respect for its literary character and a profounder impression of its Divine wisdom. The more the Bible is searched, the more will it be loved; and the stronger will the conviction grow, that its deep truths are the Divine answers to the deep wants of human nature.”<p>

In regard to the acquiring of a command of an excellent pulpit style, Stalker thus speaks:<p>

“To obtain command of language it is good to hear the best speakers and to read the best books. It has been my fortune to be acquainted with a good many celebrated preachers; and I have observed that, almost without exception, they have had a thorough acquaintance with the whole range of the higher English literature. To have the music of Shakespeare or Milton echoing in your memory, or to have lingering in your ear the cadence and sweep of the sentences of Thackeray and DeQuincy, will almost unawares give you a good style. In reading over an old sermon of my own, I can almost tell whether or not, in the week of its composition, I was reading good literature, In the former case the language is apt to be full and harmonious, and sprinkled over with gay flowers of maxim and illustration, whereas in the latter the style of the performance is apt to be bald and jerky.”<p>

Dr. Stalker took as models for preachers, Isaiah as the noblest of the Hebrew prophets, and St. Paul as the grandest of the Chris­tian apostles, devoting four lectures to each. He stated that he chose Isaiah in spite of what Jeremiah and Ezekiel had to offer because “there is nothing in Holy Writ more unique than the call of Isaiah, and it is pregnant in every line with instruction.” And of St. Paul he said: “It is my intention to speak of St. Paul, first as a man; secondly as a Christian; thirdly as an apostle; and fourthly as a thinker.” Deliberately and with the logic so dear to a dialectician Dr. Stalker followed the plan he had prepared, and these two Biblical models received full and adequate treatment at the tongue of one who was “apt to teach.” The lecturer inter­spersed his logic with memorable incidents, and as published, the footnotes are entertaining, being occasionally in a lighter vein.<p>

(An esteemed friend, the Rev. John McMillan of Ullapool, some years ago repeated to me the following rhyme on the method of constructing a sermon, and, although I have never succeeded in coming up to its standard, yet it has often floated before me with advantage in the hours of composition:<p>


 <center><table><i>
‘Begin low; Proceed slow;<br> Rise higher; Take fire;<br> When most impressed Be self-possessed;<br> To spirit wed form; Sit down in a storm.’
</table></i></center>
 E. D. Jones)<p>
Under three heads Isaiah’s call to his prophetic ministry is described in detail and graphically. Dr. Stalker concluded that section of the lecture with this comment:<p>

“Gentlemen, I have gone minutely into the details of this scene in the life of a representative preacher of the Old Testament, because every line of it speaks to the deep and subtle movements of our own experience. What is the inference to be drawn from it? Is it that at the commencement of a preacher’s career there must be a call to the ministry distinct from the experience of personal salvation? This inference has often been drawn; but I prefer, in the meantime at least, to draw a wider, but I believe, a sounder and more useful inference. It is this: that the outer must be preceded by the inner; public life for God must be preceded by private life with God; unless God has first spoken to a man, it is vain for a man to attempt to speak to God.”<p>

Lecture V, “The Preacher as a False Prophet,” is especially valu­able. The speaker gave enough space to the false prophets of Old Testament times to fix their place and evil influence in the minds of his auditors. Then he said:<p>

“The false prophets won and kept their popularity by pandering to the opinions and prejudices of the people. The times of Jeremiah were big with coming calamities, and he had to predict that these calamities were sure to come; for there were no signs of deep or genuine repentance, and, indeed, the time for repentance was past. The self-flattering, ease-loving people hated to hear these disagreeable facts. Their frivolous minds were engrossed with the gossip and excitement of the passing day, and it was too great an exertion to give their attention to the majestic views of the Divine justice and the far-reaching sweep of the Divine providence to which Jeremiah tried to direct their attention. They wished to enjoy the present and to believe that all would come right somehow. The false prophets flattered these wishes. They said that the calamities which Jeremiah was foretelling would not come to pass, or that at least they would be much less formidable than he represented. They were, as Jeremiah says, like an unconscientious physician, who is afraid to probe the wound to the bottom, though the life of the patient depends on it. Ezekiel accuses them of making nightcaps to draw over the eyes and ears of their countrymen, lest they should see and hear the truth, and of muffling with a glove the naked hand of God with which the sins of the people should have been smitten. The constant refrain of their prophecies was, “Peace, peace,” though the storm clouds of retribution were ready to burst. The people said to them, “Prophesy to us smooth things”; and the false prophets provided the supply according to the demand.”<p>

The final paragraph on the prophet Isaiah as a model preacher closed with certain weighty words. Since these words were spoken within the halls of a seminary, every word must have weighed a pound:<p>

“Allow me to say, in closing, that I believe the question, what is to be the type and tone of the ministry in any generation, is decided in the theological seminaries. What the students are there, the ministers of the country will be by-and-by. And, while the discipline of the authorities and the exhortations and examples of professors may do something, the tone of the college is determined by the students themselves. The state of feeling in a theological seminary ought to be such, that any man living a life inconsistent with his future profession should feel thoroughly uncomfortable, and have the conviction driven in upon his conscience every day, that the ministry is no place for him.”<p>

Having written a life of St. Paul, Dr. Stalker was en rapport with his theme for the next four lectures. He loved his subject, and handled it with ease and enthusiasm. In presenting “Paul the Man” he employs but three headings. For Dr. Stalker, this was unique. Usually he used twice as many.<p>

1. St. Paul was a supremely ethical nature. This perhaps was his fundamental peculiarity. Life could under no circumstances have seemed to him a trifle. The sense of responsibility was strong in him from the beginning. He was trained in a strict school…His sense of honor was keen. When, in his subsequent life, he was accused of base things-lying, hypocrisy, avarice and darker sins-he felt intense pain, crying out like one wounded, and he hurled the accusations from him with the energy of a self-respecting nature.<p>

2.	St. Paul’s intellectual gifts are so universally recognized that it is hardly worthwhile to refer to them… We think of the intellect of the system-builder as cold. But there is never any coldness about St. Paul’s mind. On the contrary, it is always full of life and all on fire. He can, indeed, reason closely and continuously; but, every now and then, his thought bursts up through the argument like a flaming geyser and falls in showers of sparks. Then the argument resumes its even tenor again; but these outbursts are the finest passages in St. Paul.<p>

3.	The intellectual superiority of St. Paul is universally acknowl­edged; and to those who only know him at a distance this is his out­standing peculiarity, But the close student of his life and character knows, that, great as he was in intellect, he was equally great in heart, perhaps even greater. One of the subtlest students of his life, the late Adoiphe Monod, of the French Church, has fixed on this as the key to his character. He calls him the Man of Tears, and shows with great persuasiveness, that herein lay the secret of his power.<p>

Dr. Stalker maintained that it is generally agreed that a certain modicum of natural gifts is necessary for those who think of enter­ing the ministry. He quotes Luther’s list of the qualifications of a minister and remarks that most of them are gifts of nature. Here they are: 1.) He should be able to teach plainly and in order. 2.) He should have a good head. 3.) Good power of language. 4.) A good voice. 5.) A good memory. 6.) He should know when to stop. 7.) He should be sure of what he means to say. 8.) And be ready to stake body and soul, goods and reputation, on its truth. 9.) He should study diligently. 10.) And suffer himself to be vexed and criticized by everyone.<p>

Among several lively anecdotes which brighten the lectures, Dr. Stalker relates this one:<p>

“The polish given by education tells, no doubt; but the size of the primordial mass of manhood tells still more. In a quaint book of reminiscences recently published from the pen of a notable minister of the last generation in the Highlands of Scotland, Mr. Sage of Resolis, there is a criticism recorded, which was passed by a parishioner on three successive ministers of a certain parish: “Our first minister,” said he, “was a man, but he was not a minister; our second was a minister, but he was not a man; and the one we have at present is neither a man nor a minister.”<p>


Expanding his ideas on “The Preacher as a Thinker” Stalker cites one of Yale’s presidents as an illustration:<p>

“President Dwight preached in the Yale College Chapel straight through the doctrines of Christianity, taking them up one by one in systematic order; and his book was long a model to preachers both in this country and Great Britain, He was preaching to an academic audience, and there are probably few congregations for which such a course would be suitable now; although I know at least one able young minister in a country village who has been pursuing this method from the commencement of his ministry. Once a month he gives a sermon of the course; perhaps his people do not know that he is doing so; but he is giving his own mind the discipline of investigating the doctrines of Christianity in their order; and I am certain he himself is growing a strong man in the process and that his people, though unconsciously, are getting the benefit of it. In the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches the observance of the Christian festivals gives occasion for regularly bringing the circle of the grand Christian facts before the minds of the people. We have not this guidance; but a faithful minister is bound to make sure that he is preaching with suf­ficient frequency on the leading Christian facts and doctrines, and that he is not omitting any essential element of Christianity.”<p>

Dr. Stalker is not so sure that the advice to the minister to culti­vate simplicity is well grounded. His answer to that kind of sug­gestion is, we may believe, characteristic :<p>

“Not unfrequently ministers are exhorted to cultivate extreme sim­plicity in their preaching. Everything ought, we are told, to be brought down to the comprehension of the most ignorant hearer, and even of children. Far be it from me to depreciate the place of the simplest in the congregation; it is one of the best features of the Church in the present day that it cares for the lambs. I dealt with this subject, not unsympathetically I hope, in a former lecture. But do not ask us to be always speaking to children or to beginners. Is the Bible always simple? Is Job simple, or Isaiah? Is the Epistle to the Romans simple, or Galatians? This cry for simplicity is three-fourths intellectual laziness; and that Church is doomed in which there is not supplied meat for men as well as milk for babes. We owe the Gospel not only to the barbarian but also to the Greek. Not only to the unwise but also to the wise.”<p>

James Stalker was himself a model preacher of the scholarly, Biblical, and expository type. Whenever he was announced to preach crowds waited upon his deliverance and were not dis­appointed. He belongs to that small but powerful group of preacher-professors in Scotland who took great subjects and held their hearers for forty-five minutes or an hour, and sent them away instructed, elated, humbled, and their hearts overflowing with “wonder, love, and praise.”<p>

In the fullness of his years, honored, admired, and beloved, Dr. Stalker died February 5, 1927. <p><center>
