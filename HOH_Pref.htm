"THE HOLY OF HOLIES"</font><font face="Arrus BT" Color="#0000aa"  size="3">
  
<p>By Aleaxander MacLaren D.D.<p>Sermons on Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters of the Gospel of John<br>1890<p>
<hr><p></center>Curators note: These sremons were published in this form in 1890, including a total of 34 sermons. Here are the first 10, with more to be added. They are also included in MacLaren's "Expositions of Holy Scripture". Upon reading , even a few of these sermons, we can understand why these were published seperatly. It would seem as if Dr. MacLaren was moved especially as he preached these messages. This book was published with no preface. As always on this site, great care has been taken in the
formatting of these sermons, nothing has been altered. As best as I know, this book is out of print and held in the public domain. Anyone knowing differently should contact, Brian Heminger: <a href="mailto:bclr@earthlink.net">bclr@earthlink.net</a><p>
