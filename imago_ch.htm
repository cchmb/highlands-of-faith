PREFACE<p></center>
IF it were permissible, I could truly describe the  origin of this book in the very words of Bunyan:<p><center>
<table><i>
When at the first I took my pen in hand<br> 
Thus for to write, I did not understand <br>
That I at all should make a little book<br> 
In such a mode; nay, I had undertook <br>
To make another; which, when almost done,<br>
 Before I was aware, I this begun.</i>
</table>
<p></center>
Whilst writing my Life of Christ, and reading extensively on the subject, the conviction was borne in upon me that no 
desideratum more urgently needs to be supplied in our theology than a work on the Mind or Teaching of Christ.  For several
 years I have been working at this task.  But, as I went on, my progress was impeded by the fact that, especially in the 
department of ethics, Jesus seemed to teach as much by His example as by His words; whereas it was my intention to derive
 His teaching from His words alone.  I commenced accordingly to write a little on His example, merely for the purpose of 
clearing the surplus material out of the way, and without any thought that it would extend beyond a chapter or two. But,
 as I wrote, it grew and grew, till, almost unawares, the plan of a new book shaped itself in my mind. Recurring to the 
quaint and pithy language of Bunyan, I may say:<p><center>

<table><i>
Having now my method by the end,<br> Still, as I pulled, it came;<br> and so I penned It down;<br> until it came at last to be,<br> For 
length and breadth,<br> the bigness which you see.<p></i></center></table>

The plan of this book, as it thus, so to speak, made itself, is-to divide the circle of human life into segments, each of 
which represents an extensive sphere of experience and duty and then to follow our Lord through them one after another, in
 order to see how He conducted Himself in each and thereby learn how to conduct ourselves in the same.  It is thus a kind 
of Christian Ethics with a practical and devotional aim. By making the segments smaller, the chapters might easily have 
been increased in number; but perhaps no very important part of life has been entirely overlooked. <p>
Each chapter has been written in full view of the whole of our Lord's behaviour, as far as it has been recorded, in the 
department of human life to which it refers; and it was at one time my intention to print in full, from the Gospels, all
 the evidence on each head.   I soon found, however, that this would be impracticable, for the evidence turned out to be 
far more voluminous than I had any conception of; and to print it in full would have swelled the book to double its size. 
It has been to me a continual astonishment to find how abundant are the materials for tracing out our Lord's example even 
in what may be considered the less important parts of life; and I thankfully confess that I have derived from this study a 
new impression of the wealth which is packed into the narrow circumference of the Four Gospels.   On the flyleaf of each 
chapter I have noted a number of the more important passages; and this list, although in no case complete, may serve as a 
starting-point to those who may wish to collect the evidence for themselves.<p>
I am persuaded that there are many at present in all the churches who are turning earnest eyes to the Example of Christ,
 and who desire an account, derived directly from the records, of how He lived this earthly life which we are living now.
 For such I have written this guide to the imitation of Christ, and I send it forth with the earnest hope that they may be
 able to find in it, in some degree, the authentic features of the image of the Son of man.<p>

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION<p></center>
A Second Edition being required a few weeks after the issue of the First, no changes have been introduced beyond a few 
trifling verbal corrections.   But I gladly avail myself of this opportunity of saying what is nowhere distinctly enough 
stated in the text, that I have not conceived the imitation of Christ to consist in the mere literal repetition of His acts,
 but rather in the application of the spirit and principles of His life to the duties and problems of our own day. At the
 same time, the way in which I have attempted to arrive at His spirit and principles has not been by a priori reasoning
 from the general conception of His character, but by the close study of His actions in detail.<p>


(Curator's note: As with all the books on this site, great care was taken to preserve the readability of the text.
 This was difficult with the numerous footnotes in multiple languages. Our best has been done, now enjoy a masterpiece,
 and draw even nearer to our Lord. I believe that this book is still in print, although I believe it to be in the public
 domain. Anyone knowing different should contact me, Brian Heminger at: <a href="mailto:bclr@earthlink.net">
