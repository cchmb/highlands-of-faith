(Edinburgh University Press T. and A. CONSTABLE 
(late) Printers to Her Majesty)<p> By The Same Author<p> IMAGO CHRISTI. THE EXAMPLE OF 
JESUS CHRIST<p></center> Thirty-third Thousand. In Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s. Red line Edition. 
Handsomely bound in padded red roan, net, 7s. bd.<p> MR. SPURGEON says: -'This is a 
delightful book, upon a glorious subject, by one who is better qualified to 
write it than any other man. With Mr. Stalker's " Life of Christ" we were 
greatly pleased, and therefore we were prepared to welcome anything from his pen 
upon a kindred subject. Our highest expectations are exceeded: this is an 
immortal book.'<p> ' The execution is full of ingenuity, and the book can be 
recommended as a devout and thoughtful commentary on practical Christian life in 
many phases. Mr. Stalker has broad sympathies and a watchful eye, and speaks in 
a tone that will commend itself to all his readers.'- Saturday Review.<p> ' Mr. 
Stalker certainly proves that the subject is a fruitful one. He shows that the 
activity of Christ was of a more varied kind than perhaps we are apt to imagine. 
He exhibits Him in the home, in the State, in society, as a friend, as a worker, 
as a sufferer, as a philanthropist, as a controversialist, as a man of feeling, 
and so on; and on all these subjects he has much that is interesting and much 
that is instructive to say. - Scotsman.<p><center> LONDON; HODDER &amp; STOUGHTON, 27

CONCERNING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS.<p> Second Edition. Crown 3vo. 
cloth, 6s.<p></center>
 'The subject handled in these lectures by Dr. Stalker is one of 
paramount importance and interest, and he has handled it not only with learning, 
but (which is rare) with judgment, steering his way with a fine critical and 
religious tact among the numberless ingenious theories that are so fully 
produced in Germany.'- Spectator.<p> 'Readers of "Imago Christi" will be prepared 
for the charm of this new work. The same freshness of treatment, the same vigour 
of style, the same evangelic fervour that we are familiar with in all Dr. 
Stalker's writings appear here. He has the art of making theology-usually deemed 
the dullest of subjects for all but its professional students- interesting to 
the general reader. But, while the style and treatment are popular in the best 
sense of the term, there lies behind a careful study of the subject in the full 
light of modern criticism.'-Critical Review.<p> ' This is a remarkable book dealing 
with the teaching of Jesus concerning Himself according lo the Synoptic Gospels. 
All the lectures are thoughtful, reverent, and interesting. . . . The book is a 
striking and valuable addition to our library of theological literature.'- 
Guardian.<p><center> LONDON; HODDER &amp; STOUGHTON, 27 PATERNOSTER ROW.<p> BY THE SAME 
AUTHOR.<p> THE TRIAL AND DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST.<br> A DEVOTIONAL HISTORY OF OUR LORD'S 
PASSION.<p> Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s. Fourth Edition, completing 10,000.<p></center>'The author
has a thorough hold of the circumstances and their literature; his style is 
admirable in its lucidity an simplicity--enriched several times by felicitous 
images, as, for instance, on page ii-and his spiritual insight is unerring. No 
intelligent person can read this book without understanding what happened, 
and-which is more important-why such things happened, ...It is a noble book. 
-DR. JOHN WATSON in The British Weekly.<p>We may view the book as a series of
plain spoken homilies on topic after topic of the Passion, strikingly told, with 
a careful dwelling on details and with an earnest telling appeal, on the lessons 
to be derived. There are some passages of great beauty, as that which dwells on 
the Saviour's look at Peter after the denial.'- Record.<p>'We have here an
exquisitely beautiful picture of the sufferings and death of our Blessed Lord.'- 
The Rock.<p> "Dr Stalkers treatment of the Seven Words from the Cross-calm, 
reverent, and impressive-may be compared with the tempestuous but splendid 
eloquence of Pere Didon's handling of the same theme in his recently published 
"Lent Conferences," as an illustration of two widely contrasted but equally 
effective styles of religious utterances. We hail Dr. Stalker's work as a 
noteworthy contribution to what may be called the Bibliography of the Cross.'- Christian World.<p><center>London: HODDER & STOUGHTON,<br> 27 Paternoster Row<p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR<p>
 THE PREACHER AND HIS MODELS.<p>Second edition, completeing 8000. Crown 8vo, cloth, 5s<p></center>
 'This volume, like all for which we are indebted to the pen of Dr. 
Stalker, ought to be in the library of every Christian minister, and of all who 
are preparing to be Christian ministers. Local preachers also would do well to 
purchase and ponder it.'-Methodist Times.<p>'Dr. Stalker sets Isaiah and Paul   
before the preacher as models for his imitation, and descants on this and 
kindred parts of ministerial work with much force and earnestness, and at the 
same time with careful sobriety. He happily avails himself of a considerable 
personal experience and a wide range of reading, and treats his subject in an 
interesting as well as stimulating manner. The volume is one of great 
excellence.'-Scotsman<p>
 ' Nothing can surpass the strong common sense and the 
practical wisdom of Dr. Stalker's discriminations in these discussions. Dr. 
Stalker's lectures are characterised by strong masculine good sense, large 
reading and observation, a wise use of experience, and felicitous illustration. 
Dr. Stalker has again demonstrated the inexhaustibleness and perennial interest 
of the sacred records. No lessons for preachers so wise, manifold, and urgent 
are elsewhere to be found.'-Evangelical Magazine.<p><center>

 THE FOUR MEN.<p>
 Crown 8vo, 
cloth, 2s. 6a Second Edition, completeing 10,000<p></center>
 'As a guide to self-knowledge his book ought to be in the hands of 
every young man who has not lost faith in religion, and has some aspiration to 
attain to the highest type of manhood. '-Christian.<p>
 ' There is a manly and godly 
tone about the teaching of the book, which makes it interesting. Easy to read 
and likely to be useful. Young men especially would be sure to be captivated by 
it.'- Record. ' The subjects are such as attract young men; and it need scarcely 
be said that they are treated in a lively, lucid, and vigorous manner.'- 
Expositor.<p>
 ' More thoughtful, suggestive addresses than the eight gathered in 
the compass of this dainty volume it would be hard to find.'-Queen.<p><center>
