ENVY<p></center> FOUR hundred years ago a 
Scottish poet-the greatest of all our Scots bards, in my opinion, with the 
single exception of Burns- wrote a famous poem, entitled ' The Dance of the 
Seven Deadly Sins.' It is a vision of hell, but very unlike the composition of 
Dante called by the same name. The daring poet imagines a holiday in hell, when 
Satan calls for a dance, and the different groups of partners are led out on the 
floor by the deadly sins. It is a bizarre and gruesome conception, such as the 
Scottish muse has always had a partiality for-this ancient poem of William 
Dunbar is a forerunner of Burns' 'Tam o' Shanter- but it affords the opportunity 
of a most graphic and pointed description of the deadly sins, an effort not 
unnatural to a churchman, as Dun-bar was. Perhaps, as a specimen, his picture of 
Envy may be quoted, though the words will hardly, I fear, be intelligible-<p></font>

The dance of 
the deadly sins is placed by the poet in hell; but it goes on in many a brain, 
and the devil provides the music.<p><center> I.<p></center> Envy is grief or displeasure at the good of 
another-the good consisting of wealth or fame, or any other possession which men 
prize. And it is only the reverse side of the medal if we feel delight and 
exultation in another's evil-in his failure or ill success, or any other kind of 
calamity.<p> It is of consequence in the case of this sin to be particular about 
the definition, because there are motions of the mind not unlike it which are 
not vicious but virtuous. There is, for instance, emulation, which is frequently 
confounded with envy, but is, in fact, quite different. Emulation is also 
excited by a neighbour's good; but the effect is not the same-envy produces a 
sense of depression and despair, but emulation produces feelings of admiration 
and imitation. Emulation may, indeed, desire to excel the virtue or ability, 
which it copies-this is its nature-but it does so not for the sake of 
outstripping a rival, but in the sheer desire for excellence.<p> Envy, in short, is 
ill-humoured, and emulation good-humoured desire to excel. The old writers used 
to distinguish from envy another feeling to which they gave the name of 
nemesis-a word which we do not now use in this sense; in fact, I hardly think we 
have any name for the feeling itself.<p> It was lawful, they thought, to grieve 
over the success of another or to rejoice in his downfall, if it was in the 
interest of the public cause. Thus a good man might lawfully grieve over the 
social elevation of a neighbour whose influence was likely to lower the moral 
tone of the locality, or a patriot might lawfully rejoice in the downfall of a 
tyrant.<p> Perhaps, also, we may lawfully grieve at another's worldly prosperity, 
if it is obviously doing him spiritual harm, and wish to see his career checked, 
to make him think. But such sentiments are easily vitiated by the introduction 
of a personal element, because as one of La Rochefoucauld's biting maxims says, 
' few are able to suppress in themselves a secret satisfaction at the 
misfortunes of their friends'. At all events, it is the selfish element, which is 
the poisonous ingredient in envy-the sense that we are affronted because another 
rises, or that we reap benefit and gratification from another's humiliation.<p><center> II.<p></center> 
It may not be thought that this sin is worthy to be ranked with those we have 
already discussed-pride, avarice and luxury -and certainly, in some respects, it 
comes short of their colossal proportions. But there is something 
extraordinarily mean in the spirit, which is unhappy and disappointed because 
another succeeds, while it glories in another's misfortunes. Such sentiments 
betray a selfish isolation and an utter absence of love, which cannot but be 
both demoralising to character and, in the highest degree, displeasing to the 
God of love.<p> In history, envy has been the cause of some of the greatest crimes. 
The second notable sin of the world-the murder of Abel -was prompted by this 
base passion. Cain could not bear that there should be anyone more acceptable to 
God than himself. And may we not say that a great many of the persecutions and 
martyrdoms suffered by the people of God in every age have been due to the same 
cause-to the spite of the wicked at the existence of those whom they have 
secretly felt to be better than themselves?<p> A great many of the worst sins of 
the tongue are the product of envy. It is miserable to think how much of 
conversation consists of disparaging remarks about the character or the talents, 
the position or the conduct of others. Gossips cannot but admit the brilliance 
or the benevolence of the person they are criticizing, but- Oh, with how many of 
these envious ' buts ' is conversation garnished. Those who make use of them not 
infrequently claim for themselves, as they do so, the character of virtue: they 
are sorry they have to say what is about to follow; really it gives them pain to 
have to reveal it; but truth compels. Yet they have been working up to it all 
the time: they have only laid on the praise that they might the more effectively 
introduce the exception which was to cancel all. There are those who are 
cleverer still: they do not themselves make the damaging statements, but draw 
them out of the mouths of others, openly deprecating the censures in which they 
secretly rejoice.<p> How is it that we can be so petty and so false? Why should the 
humiliation of another thus afford us gratification? There are people who are 
sick with fear lest another should attain an honour which they themselves have 
not been able to reach and sick with chagrin because others are happier than 
themselves. But the worst element in their own unhappiness is their pettiness. 
Envy is its own punishment. To be consumed by this passion inwardly, and to live 
and move outwardly in an atmosphere of gossip and detraction, is a hell upon 
earth. Yet many are living in it.<p> Not only individuals, but families, classes, 
and even nations, can allow themselves to fall into this state of mind. There is 
a widespread belief that the glory and prosperity of our own country are 
regarded by certain other countries with chronic envy; but this idea is probably 
exaggerated; and, at all events, it will be safer for ourselves to remember that 
other nations believe us to be chronically the prey of a feeling not dissimilar 
to envy-the desire of Ahab for Naboth's vineyard.<p> We have not yet had in this 
country much of that bitter feeling between rich and poor which, on the part of 
the less fortunate, is mere envy of the more fortunate; but on the Continent 
this has been a prominent feature of the propaganda of socialism and communism. 
I have myself sat an entire day in a gathering of the International, where 
orators from the great cities of Germany were haranguing a crowd of working men. 
From the oratorical point of view, the speeches were of the most brilliant 
quality; but not one word was said of the interest or pride which a man should 
take in his work for its own sake, the only string harped upon being 
denunciation of the plutocracy for running away with more than its own share of 
the spoil. In the contests among ourselves between the different classes of 
society there has hitherto, I think, prevailed much more of the spirit of 
good-humour. And long may this continue; for nothing can poison the happiness of 
any class so completely as envy for the goods of those above them. By all means 
let emulation prevail, and let the pathways be opened to merit; but it would do 
no good to those underneath in the social scale to blot out the image of a more 
refined life displayed in the class above them; for this is the very magnet 
which draws them upwards.<p><center> III.<p></center> There are, no doubt, some natures more inclined to 
the sin of envy than others. It has sometimes been spoken of as a sin of the 
strong, who cannot endure that smaller people than themselves should appropriate 
any of their praise or obtain any share of their possessions; and there have 
been in history remarkable instances of this insane desire to engross 
everything, as, for instance, that of Alexander the Great, who is said not to 
have tolerated any praise of his own generals, esteeming any recognition 
bestowed on them as subtracted from his own glory. But, I should fancy, envy is 
principally a vice of the weak, who, finding themselves beaten in the 
competition of life, grow sick with disappointment and are ready not only to 
envy man but to reproach God. 'Why has He created me as I am? Why has He not 
given me the gifts lavished on others?' As well might anyone ask, ' Why am I not 
six feet high?' As well might the clay say to the potter, 'Why hast thou made me 
thus? '<p> Very moderate abilities may be associated with limitless ambitions. A 
woman with but a tolerable voice may be as hungry for praise as a prima donna, 
or the orator of a town council covet as much recognition as would be the due of 
a statesman able to command the applause of listening senates; and, when the 
expected tribute is not paid, the sensitive, artistic nature is plunged in gloom 
and discontentment. Not infrequently envy is the fruit of idleness and laziness.<p> 
Many have been endowed by nature with talents sufficient to win for them a 
foremost place, but they have not made use of them. Instead of living laborious 
days, they have expected fortune to drop into their lap, and, instead of 
cultivating their minds by burning the midnight oil, they have calculated on 
winning the prize by genius or cleverness alone. Then, when they see the object 
of their ambition passing to those who have worked for it, they murmur against 
Providence and blame their stars. But they have only themselves to blame. A man 
of distinction, who was being assailed by envious detractors, said, ' They wish 
to have my fortune, but why do they not wish to have my labours? '(See a capital sermon on Envy by South.)
 <p><center> IV.<p></center> If it be 
asked how envy is to be cured in a nature which may be prone to it, I should 
say, first of all, Learn to love excellence for its own sake. In an old castle 
in the heart of Germany, celebrated for its picturesque situation and its noble 
proportions, and rendered famous by the fact that Martin Luther, the reformer, 
spent in it one of the most eventful years of his life, there is a wonderful 
series of proverbs painted on the walls, one of which runs as follows:-<p>


<center><table><i> Ich llebe was fein ist<br> Ob es wohl nicht mein 
ist,<br> Und mir nicht werden kann,<br> So hab 'ich doch meine Lust und Freud' daran.<p> 
which may be rendered thus:-<p>I love a thing that's fine<br> Ev'n when it is not 
mine,<br> And, though it never mine can be,<br> Yet it delights and gladdens me.</i></table><p></center>



 For 
many a year this old rhyme has haunted my memory and helped me, I hope, to keep 
envy at bay. To have an eye for whatever is fine, even though it is not ours and 
never can be ours, immensely increases our resources, for the world abounds with 
fine and noble things, and in a real sense they belong to us if we have the 
power of appreciating them. I once said to the owner of an estate in which I had 
the privilege of walking, and in which I walked nearly every day for years, that 
it was more mine than his, for he seldom visited it; and we may become very rich 
if we make the most of all the fine things that are accessible to our 
observation and enjoyment.<p> This argument acquires far more force when those whom 
we are tempted to envy are using their talents for the glory of God and the good 
of the world. What! do we grudge that humanity should be served and God 
glorified by powers superior to our own? Would we impoverish the cause of 
progress or of the Gospel by restricting it to the support of those inferior to 
ourselves? We cannot love the good cause very passionately if we do not welcome 
every talent consecrated to its service.<p> Yet, it is to be feared envy enters 
sometimes into the most sacred service. The human nature in a minister is tried 
when someone is settled in the same town whose fame puts out the light of his 
popularity, and it may take a time before even a good man can say, ' He must 
increase, but I must decrease.'<p> There is a kind of vicarious envy which it is 
even more difficult to check-when a man's family or friends are more jealous of 
his position and influence than he is himself, and find it more difficult than 
he to brook the interference of a rival. Thus, in the Old Testament, the family 
of Moses looked with an evil eye on the prophesying of Eldad and Medad. But the 
great man of God, rising above the sentiments of his own champions, said to 
Joshua, ' Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were 
prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them.' In like manner, 
when St. Paul's friends were drawing his attention to the shortcomings of rival 
preachers, he said, ' Nevertheless, every way Christ is preached, and I therein 
do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.'<p> I will give you one more remedy for envy: 
Count your mercies. The envious are always comparing themselves with their more 
fortunate neighbours; but the world contains many who are less fortunate than 
any of us; and why should we not sometimes think of them? If you ever enter an 
almshouse or a poorhouse, you will feel yourself to be wealthy, even if you have 
only a moderate income; if you pass through the wards of a hospital, you will 
thank God for your good health, even if you sometimes have a headache or a 
toothache; and so, by thinking sometimes of the multitudes less gifted or less 
prosperous than ourselves, we shall make the springs of gratitude flow within 
us.<p> Do the mercies we have to be thankful for include the great salvation? Is 
our soul redeemed, and do we carry the hope of immortality in our breasts? If 
so, how can we ever be disappointed or envious? If we only realised how much we 
possess when we possess Christ, our mouth would be filled with laughter and our 
tongue with praise all the day long, and, catching the spirit of the Saviour, we 
should be able to rejoice with them who do rejoice and to weep with them who 
weep; and this is the final victory over envy.<p>
