LUXURY<p></center> THE Latin name given by the old writers to the third of the Seven Deadly 
Sins is luxuria, and I have translated it literally by the English word luxury.' 
But our word is a euphemism for what was meant, for the sin which the schoolmen 
thus designated was what we should rather call sensuality or licentiousness-in a 
word, all offences of whatever kind against the seventh commandment.<p> This is a 
sin of which it is difficult to speak, and in ordinary circumstances the less 
said about it the better. Silence is sometimes more eloquent than speech, and 
the reticence in which this sin is shrouded is the severest of all 
condemnations; for it signifies that sins of this kind are so bad that it is a 
shame even to speak of them.<p> Still, reticence may be carried too far. The Bible 
is not silent on this subject. On the contrary, it not only speaks but thunders 
against it. In the Book of Proverbs, for example, which is especially intended 
as a handbook of the journey of life for young men, there is no other sin 
treated with so much amplitude and repetition. There is abundance of facts-of 
secrets known to all-in the life of the present day in both town and country to 
lay on the pulpit the obligation, unless it is to exhibit cowardice, to speak, 
if not frequently, at least firmly and fearlessly on this subject. Too absolute 
ignorance on the part of the young of the kind of world they are living in may 
give temptation a cruel advantage over them; for the force of temptation often 
lies in surprise.<p> One of the things impressed on my mind by what I have come to 
know, as a minister is the early age at which the most dangerous temptations 
have often to be faced. Even at school attempts may be made to corrupt the mind. 
Young men are certain to be tempted, the assault on their virtue sometimes 
coming from the most unlikely quarters. Even young women need to be warned, as 
they go out into the world, that their ruin may be attempted by the very men 
from whom they should receive consideration and protection. No doubt there is a 
danger of kindling, by speech, the very fire we wish to quench; but there is an 
instinct in healthy minds which tells them whether what is said on this subject 
proceeds from pruriency or moral earnestness; and I am not much afraid of being 
misunderstood, while I am sure that I can calculate upon sympathy in discharging 
a difficult duty.<p><center> I.<p></center> Let us begin where the Bible begins-with the thoughts. Our 
Lord Himself said that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath 
committed adultery already in his heart; and St. Paul confesses that his own 
first sense of sin arose from the power of lustful thoughts. To such purely 
internal motions of the flesh heathenism attached no importance; and there are 
many to whom, so far from being repulsive, they form a part of the pleasure of 
existence, to which they return whenever their thoughts are released from 
occupation with other subjects. But there can be no doubt that these are of 
enormous importance to character. It is not only that the indulgence of such 
thoughts in secret prepares the way for open yielding to temptation, but such 
thoughts themselves deeply stain and pollute the soul. The oftener they are 
repeated the more inevitably does the mind return to the same subject. 
Physiology would say, that in the very substance of the brain channels are dug 
to make the course of the current easy, till, at last, control is wholly lost, 
and the brain becomes a pandemonium of licentious scenes and images. Even the 
life of dreams is invaded by the habit, till, to a conscience not wholly 
blunted, sleep itself may become a kind of terror.<p> The true defence against this 
tyranny of a foul imagination is the preoccupation of the mind with manly and 
healthy subjects. What is bad can only be kept out by filling the mind 
beforehand with what is good. The more numerous the wholesome interests a young 
man has the better, to keep him from brooding on illegitimate themes. The mind 
depends to a considerable extent on the body, and a good state of health, kept 
up by plenty of exercise, fresh air and cold water, is an effective foe of 
morbid reveries.<p><center> II.<p></center> Secondly, this sin may be committed in words. In this 
respect, indeed, there has been a vast improvement in the habits of society. A 
hundred years ago, just as profanity in speech was notoriously prevalent, even 
in the highest classes, so there was a freedom in speaking of those things of 
which it is a shame to speak that would not now be tolerated; and, if you go 
further back in the history of this country-say, to the period immediately 
before the Reformation-you will find that our nation has been slowly emerging 
from a horrible pit of grossness. Open talk of this kind is now banished to the 
lowest and rudest portion of the population, and the man is branded who attempts 
to introduce it into society that has any respect for itself.<p> Yet there are 
circumstances in which the old evil habit tends to recrudesce. For example, when 
young men are met together in the evening there is a tendency, as the night 
grows late, to allow the conversation to wander on forbidden ground. Then men 
reveal what is in them-the objects on which they brood and dream when they are 
by themselves-and one story of a questionable kind calls forth another. It is an 
hour to exercise watchfulness. A man who, in such circumstances, holds himself 
aloof will always command the respect of those whose approval is of value; and 
the silence of even one member of a company will not fail to touch the 
consciences of the rest, for all are in their hearts ashamed of the beast in 
themselves which they are permitting to become visible.<p> Along with conversation, 
may be mentioned reading of an unhealthy character. This is a difficult subject, 
because it is not easy to say where the line should be drawn, and because this 
is a case where the maxim holds good) that what is one man's food may be another 
man's poison. A mind pure and mature may peruse with advantage books, which 
would be to another like fire taken into the bosom. A young reader should not be 
ashamed to confess to himself or, if necessary, to others, that there are books 
which he cannot read with impunity; and, whatever be the course which others may 
pursue, he should judge by the effect produced on his own imagination.<p> In this 
respect also we are in a vastly improved position in comparison with our 
fathers. Last century the books in the English language adapted for hours of 
recreation and amusement were stained through and through with moral depravity, 
resembling, in this respect, the bulk of French literature at the present day, 
which, I often think, must reduce to despair those in that country who are 
really concerned about the morals of the young.<p> It was the Evangelical Revival 
that drove the satyr from English literature, and it is only the prevalence of 
an earnest religious spirit that can keep it out. Ever and anon it attempts to 
show its cloven hoof, and there cannot be a doubt that there are pens ready 
enough, for the sake of gain, to minister, if they dared, to the vilest 
passions. But it is not possible to be thankful enough for the general tone of 
literature amongst us during the last hundred years- for great 'poets, like 
Wordsworth and Coleridge, Tennyson and Browning, who have uttered nothing 
base-and for great imaginative writers, like Scott, Thackeray and Dickens, who 
are at this hour finding worthy successors in the writers of the Scottish 
School. In the work of all these there is presented an ideal of love which has 
done an immense deal to refine the habits both of thought and action in the 
population.<p> In the older writers love is confounded with lust; but these authors 
all recognise and teach that ' lust is no more love than Etna's breath is 
summer, and love is no more lust than seraphs' songs are discord.' There is, in 
fact, nothing which so successfully banishes lust from the thoughts as a pure 
and absorbing affection; and there are no better teachers than those who foster 
in the popular mind the belief that this passion is man's chief earthly 
happiness. Our poets and novelists have constituted themselves a priesthood of 
the love of woman in a way not dissimilar to that in which preachers are the 
priests of the love of God; they make the attainment of this love the goal of 
life in the same way as ministers make the love of Christ man's chief end; and, 
in fighting down the brute and cultivating the unselfish emotions, we owe much 
to the earthly as well as to the heavenly evangel.<p><center> III.<p></center> On deeds of sensual 
sin-the third aspect of the subject-I naturally hesitate to say anything. The 
peculiarity of such sins is that they involve the guilt of more than one. And 
herein, to a mind, which has caught any faintest breath of the spirit of Christ, 
ought to lie the strongest defence against committing them. To sin oneself is 
bad enough, but to involve another soul in sin is diabolical, and especially in 
sin, which brings such utter shame and reprobation as this, does upon woman. The 
complaint is often made that the punishment falls so much more severely on the 
one sinner than on the other, and it cannot be denied that the contrast is 
cruel; yet the loss to society would be infinitely greater than the gain to 
justice if the inequality were to be redressed by lowering the standard of 
womanly purity.<p> Rather must the change take place in the opposite direction-by 
causing man to feel how hideous a crime it is to sacrifice the character of 
another to his own desires. This he ought to feel out of his own heart; but, if 
he has not enough manliness to do so, it ought to be brought home to him by the 
aversion and stigma of society.<p> It is not, however, true, though one would fain 
believe it, that temptation invariably comes from the side of man. By taking 
this for granted a young and inexperienced soul may find itself unexpectedly in 
a most dangerous position. This was the peril to which Joseph was exposed, and 
many a one in every generation since has been surprised from quarters as little 
suspected. Surely Satan never achieves a triumph more complete than when she who 
was intended by her Creator to be the priestess of chastity and to refine and 
elevate man's coarser nature becomes his temptress and lures him to his undoing; 
but the streets of every city in the world bear painful evidence to the success 
with which even this master-stroke of hellish deceit has been achieved.<p> In this 
respect some of our cities are honourably distinguished by the comparative 
decency of the streets, and too much credit cannot be given to the public 
officials to whom this is due; but in others open vice has been allowed to reach 
dimensions which are a horrible public scandal; and every young man going from 
the country to the town ought to be forewarned. There is no sin which more 
quickly or inevitably destroys both soul, body and fortune; and especially to 
this open and unblushing form of indulgence nature herself has attached 
penalties of disease, descending often from generation to generation, so ghastly 
as to act as a glaring danger-signal on the downward road.<p><center> IV.<p></center> Most of what I 
have said has been intended to put readers on their guard against being 
surprised by this sin, and I have taken it for granted that the conscience will 
immediately condemn it as soon as its true nature is realised. But not 
infrequently in the literature of the day there is insinuated a libertinism the 
object of which is to corrupt the conscience, and many minds are subtle enough 
to invent for themselves the same kind of sophistry. If, it may be argued, this 
appetite is native to man, why should it not be indulged like any other natural 
desire? This is an argument, which often has been used to break down the defence 
of virtue.<p> But our appetites are not given us merely for indulgence, but also 
for restraint. Every one of them has to be kept in its own place. If man 
surrendered himself, without restraint, to his natural impulses, he would be a 
beast. It is by mastering his impulses, and by the exercise of self-control, 
that he becomes a man.<p> And this is the supreme instance in which self-control 
has to be exercised. Here the effort is more difficult, needs to be more 
frequently repeated, and is more prolonged than anywhere else. But the reward is 
correspondingly great. It is great in social life, for the chaste nation is the 
strong and prosperous nation; and what would the family be without chastity? It 
is great, too, for the individual: -<p><center> So dear to heaven is saintly chastity<br> That, 
when a soul is found sincerely so,<br> A thousand liveried angels lackey her,<br> 
Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,<br> And, in clear dream and solemn 
vision,<br> Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear.<p></center> Granted that the instinct 
-is one of the very strongest in our nature, is it not worthy of the Author of 
nature to have consecrated it to the sole service of unselfish love? Fatherhood, 
motherhood, childhood, home- there are no more sacred words in the world than 
these; and that warmth is worthy of a unique consecration which, moving secretly 
in the stock of humanity, causes such exquisite flowers to burgeon on its 
surface.<p> The Christian rules of chastity may seem harsh or cruel, but they are 
the prickly sheath which guards the most perfect flower of human happiness. A 
young man's worthiest dream is to see himself the centre of a virtuous home, to 
which he has brought a purity as perfect as that which he demands in the partner 
of his life, thus ensuring, as far as in him lies, the health and character of 
those who may come after him. This is the true earthly paradise: it is worth 
toiling for, it is worth waiting for, and it is worth denying oneself for.<p> Yet 
this is not the highest motive. We cannot dispense with that old motive with 
which Joseph defended himself in the hour of temptation, ' How can I do this 
great wickedness and sin against God? ' What the tempter whispers is, ' No eye 
will see you, nobody will ever know'; and there are circumstances in which this 
argument comes with terrific force, as for example, in a foreign country, where 
the stranger is not known to a single soul. But there is an Eye, which sees 
everywhere. Blessed is he who respects his own conscience and his God as much as 
a whole theatre of spectators.<p> Even yet, however, we have not reached the final 
motive. There is no sin, which holds its victims in more hopeless captivity than 
this. If once one has fallen under its power in any form, it is almost 
impossible to escape again; as the Book of Proverbs says of the strange woman, ' 
none that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of 
life.' But the impossible is not impossible to God, for with God all things are 
possible. Christ Jesus is the Saviour not only from guilt but from sin, and from 
this sin as well as others. Of this there is an immortal illustration in the 
case of perhaps the greatest intellect ever won to the service of the Gospel.<p> 
St. Augustine was, in his unregenerate days, held captive by this sin, and in 
his Confessions he has told the story of his miserable bondage and his ultimate 
and complete emancipation. At the crisis of his conversion he was plunged in 
horrible distress between the force of inclination on the one hand and the call 
of conscience on the other; but it was a power far above his own that rescued 
him at last. He was sitting in a garden with his companion, Alypius, when he 
suddenly rose to seek a lonely place, where he might give way, unobserved, to 
his emotion. As he went, he heard a voice, as of a boy or girl playing, which 
said, 'Take and read,' 'Take and read.' He turned back, and, lifting a book, 
which happened to be the Epistle to the Romans, from the table at which his 
companion was still seated, he let his eye fall on the first words which met 
him, and they were these: ' Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting 
and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying: 
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to 
fulfil the lusts thereof.' These were God's own words, and in them the hand of 
God gripped him. He felt that the long struggle had been taken in hand by One 
mightier than himself. Christ had redeemed him; and from that time forth, in 
union with Christ, he became a holy man. When Christ is in the heart, no sin can 
permanently abide in it.<p> The love of Christ constraineth us to abandon 
everything inconsistent with His presence. ' What! know ye not that your body is 
the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are 
not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your 
body, and in your spirit, which are God's.'<p>
