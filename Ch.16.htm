<CENTER>CHAPTER XVI
<P>THE THIRD WORD FROM THE CROSS[1]
</center>
<P>
In the life of our Lord from first to last there is a strange blending
of the majestic and the lowly.  When a beam of His divine dignity is
allowed to shine out and dazzle us, it is never long before there
ensues some incident which reminds us that He is bone of our bone and
flesh of our flesh; and, contrariwise, when He does anything which
impressively brings home to us His humanity, there always follows
something to remind us that He was greater than the sons of men.  Thus
at His birth He was laid in a manger; yet out on the pastures of
Bethlehem angels sang His praise.  Long afterwards He was asleep in the
end of the boat, and so overcome with fatigue that He needed to be
awakened to realise His danger; but immediately He rebuked the winds
and the waves, and there was a great calm.  When He saw the grief of
Martha and Mary, "Jesus wept"; but only a few minutes afterwards He
cried, "Lazarus, come forth," and He was obeyed.  So it was to the very
last.  In studying the Second Word from the cross we saw Him opening
the gates of Paradise to the penitent thief; to-day the Third Word will
show Him to us as the Son of a woman, concerned in His dying hour for
her bodily sustenance.<p>

I.

The eye of Jesus, roving over the multitude whose component parts have
been already described, lighted on His mother standing at the foot of
the cross.  In the words of the great mediaeval hymn, which is known to
all by its opening words, _Stabat mater_, and from the fact that it has
been set to music by such masters as Palestrina, Haydn and Rossini,<p>

  "Beside the cross in tears<br>
    The woeful mother stood,<br>
  Bent 'neath the weight of years,<br>
    And viewed His flowing blood;<br>
  Her mind with grief was torn,<br>
    Her strength was ebbing fast,<br>
And through her heart forlorn<br>
    The sword of anguish passed."<p>

When she carried her Infant into the temple in the pride of young
motherhood, the venerable Simeon foretold that a sword would pierce
through her own soul also.  Often perhaps had she wondered, in happy
days, what this mysterious prediction might mean.  But now she knew,
for the sword was smiting her, stab after stab.<p>

It is always hard for a mother to see her son die.  She naturally
expects him to lay her head in the grave.  Especially is this the case
with the first-born, the son of her strength.  Jesus was only
thirty-three, and Mary must have reached the age when a mother most of
all leans for support on a strong and loving son.<p>

Far worse, however, was the death He was dying--the death of a
criminal.  Many mothers have had to suffer from the kind of death their
children have died, when it has been in great agony or in otherwise
distressing circumstances.  But what mother's sufferings were ever
equal to Mary's?  There He hung before her eyes; but she was helpless.
His wounds bled, but she dared not stanch them; His mouth was parched,
but she could not moisten it.  These outstretched arms used to clasp
her neck; she used to fondle these pierced hands and feet.  Ah! the
nails pierced her as well as Him; the thorns round His brow were a
circle of flame about her heart; the taunts flung at Him wounded her
likewise.<p>

But there was worse still--the sword cut deeper.  Had not the angel
told her before His birth, "He shall be great, and shall be called the
Son of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of
His father David; and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever;
and of His kingdom there shall be no end"?  This greatness, this
throne, this crown, this kingdom--where were they?  Once she had
believed that she really was what the angel had called her--the most
blessed of women--when she saw Him lying in her lap in His beautiful
infancy, when the Shepherds and the Magi came to adore Him, and when
Simeon and Anna recognised Him as the Messiah.  After that ensued the
long period of His obscurity in Nazareth.  He was only the village
carpenter; but she did not weary, for He was with her in their home;
and she was confident that the greatness, the throne, the crown, the
kingdom would all come in good time.  At last His hour struck; and,
casting down His tools and bidding her farewell, He went forth out of
the little valley into the great world.  It is all coming now, she
said.  Soon the news arrived of the words of grace and power He was
speaking, of the multitudes following Him, of the nation being roused,
and of the blind, the lame, the diseased, the bereaved who blessed Him
for giving joy back to their lives, and blessed her who had borne Him.
It is all coming to pass, she said.  But then followed other news--of
reaction, of opposition, of persecution.  Her heart sank within her.
She could not stay where she was.  She left Nazareth and went away
trembling to see what had happened.  And now she stands at the foot of
His cross.  He is dying; and the greatness, the glory, and the kingdom
have never come.<p>

What could it mean?  Had the angel been a deceiver, and God's word a
lie, and all the wonders of His childhood a dream?  We know the
explanation now: Jesus was about to climb a far loftier throne than
Mary had ever imagined, and the cross was the only road to it.  Before
many weeks were over Mary was to understand this too; but meantime it
must have been dark as Egypt to her, and her heart must have been
sorrowful even unto death.  The sword had pierced very deep.<p>


II.<p>

There were other women with Mary beneath the cross--two of them Marys,
like herself.[2]  As an ancient father[3] has said, the weaker sex on
this occasion proved itself the stronger.  When the apostles had
forsaken their Master and fled, these women were true to the last.
Perhaps, indeed, their sex protected them.  Women can venture into some
places where men dare not go; and this is a talent which many women
have used for rendering services to the Saviour which men could not
have performed.<p>

But there was one there who had not this protection, and who in
venturing so near must have taken his life in his hand.  St. John, I
suppose, is included with the rest of the apostles in the sad statement
that they all forsook their Master and fled.  But, if so, his panic can
only have lasted a moment.  He was present at the very commencement of
the trial; and here he still is with his Master at the last--the only
one of all the Twelve.  Perhaps, indeed, the acquaintance with the
high-priest, which availed him to get into the palace where the trial
took place, may still have operated in his favour.  But it was most of
all his greater devotion that brought him to his Master's side.  He who
had leaned on His breast could not stay away, whatever might be the
danger.  And he had his reward; for he was permitted to render a last
service to Jesus amidst His agony, and he received from Him a token of
confidence which by a heart like his must have been felt to be an
unspeakable privilege and honour.<p>

III.<p>

It is most of all, however, with the impression made by the situation
on Jesus Himself that we wish to acquaint ourselves.<p>

He looked on His mother; and it was with an unpreoccupied eye, that was
able to disengage its attention from every other object by which it was
solicited.  He was suffering at the time an extremity of pain which
might have made Him insensible to everything beyond Himself.  Or, if He
had composure enough to think, a dying man has many things to reflect
upon within his own mind.  Christ, we know, had a whole world of
interests to attend to; for now He was engaged in a final wrestle with
the problem to which His whole life had been devoted.  The prayer on
behalf of His enemies does not surprise us so much, for it may be said
to have been part of His office to intercede for sinners; nor His
address to the penitent thief, for this also was quite in harmony with
His work as the Saviour.  But we do wonder that in such an hour He had
leisure to attend to a domestic detail of ordinary life.  Men who have
been engaged in philanthropic and reformatory schemes have not
infrequently been unmindful of the claims of their own families; and
they have excused themselves, or excuse has been made for them, on the
ground that the public interest predominated over the rights of their
relatives.  Now and then Jesus Himself spoke as if He took this view:
He would not allow His plans to be interfered with even by His mother.
But now He showed that, though He could not but refuse her unjust
interference, He had never for a moment forgotten her just claims or
her true interests.  In spite of His greatness and in spite of His
work, He still remained Mary's Son and bore to her an undying affection.<p>

The words He spoke were, indeed, few; but they completely covered the
case.  Every word He uttered in that position was with great pain;
therefore He could not say much.  Besides, their very fewness imparted
to them a kind of judicial dignity; as has been said, this was Christ's
last will and testament.  To His mother He said, "Woman, behold thy
son," [4] indicating St. John with His eyes; and to the disciple He
merely said, "Behold thy mother."  It was simple, yet comprehensive; a
plain, almost legal direction, and yet overflowing with love to both
Mary and John.<p>

It is supposed that Joseph, the husband of the Virgin, had died before
our Lord's public career began, and that in Nazareth the weight of the
household had fallen on the shoulders of Jesus.  No doubt, during His
years of preaching, He would tenderly care for His mother.  But now He
too was leaving her, and the widow would be without support.  It was
for this He had to provide.<p>

He had no money to leave her; His earthly all, when He was crucified,
consisted of the clothes He wore; and these fell to the soldiers.  But
it is one of the privileges of those who, though they may be poor
themselves, make many rich with the gifts of truth, that they thereby
win friends who are proud and eager to serve them or theirs.  In
committing His mother to St. John Jesus knew that the charge would be
accepted not as a burden but a gift.<p>

Why she did not go to the home of one of her other sons it is
impossible to say.  They were not yet believers, though soon afterwards
they became so; but there may have been other reasons also, to us
unknown.<p>

At all events, it is easy to see how kind and considerate was the
selection of St. John for this office.  There are indications in the
Gospels that St. John was wealthier, or at least more comfortable in
his circumstances, than the rest of the Apostles; and this may have
weighed with Jesus: He would not send His mother where she would feel
herself to be a burden.  It is highly probable also that St. John was
unmarried.  But there were deeper reasons.  There was no arm on which
His mother could lean so confidently as that of him who had leaned on
her Son's breast.  St. Peter, with his hot temper and rough fisherman's
ways, would not have been nearly so eligible a choice.  John and Mary
were kindred spirits.  They were especially one in their intense
affection for Jesus.  They would never tire of speaking to one another
about Him.  He honoured both of them in each other's eyes by giving
them to one another in this way.  If He gave Mary a great gift in
giving her St. John for a son, He gave him no less a gift by giving him
such a mother; for Mary could not but be an ornament to any home.
Besides, did He not make St. John in a quite peculiar sense His own
brother by substituting him in His own stead as the son of Mary?<p>

The Evangelist says that from that hour John took her to his own home.
Many have understood this to mean that he at once gently withdrew her
from the spot, that she should not be agitated by seeing the
death-throes of her Son, though he himself returned to Calvary.  It is
said by tradition that they lived together twelve years in Jerusalem,
and that he refused to leave the city, even for the purpose of
preaching the gospel, as long as Mary survived.  Only after her death
did he depart on those missionary travels which landed him in Ephesus
and its neighbourhood, with which his later history is connected.<p>

IV.<p>

It is not difficult to read the lesson of this touching scene.  From
the pulpit of His cross Jesus preaches to all ages a sermon on the
fifth commandment.<p>

The heart of the mother of Jesus was pierced with a sword on account of
His sufferings.  It was a sharp weapon; but Mary had one thing on which
to steady up her soul; it kept her calm even in the wildest moment of
her grief--she knew He was innocent.  He had always been pure, noble
and good; she could be proud of Him even when they were crucifying Him.
Many a mother's heart is pierced with anguish on account of a son's
illness, or misfortunes, or early death; but she can bear it if she is
not pierced with the poisoned sword.  What is that?  It is when she has
to be ashamed of her child--when he is brought to ruin by his own
misdeeds.  This is a sorrow far worse than death.<p>

How beautiful it is to see a mother wearing as her chief ornament the
good name and the honourable success of a son!  You who still have a
mother or a father, let this be to you both a spur to exertion and a
talisman against temptation.  To some is accorded the rarer privilege
of being able to support their parents in old age.  And surely there is
no sweeter memory in the world than the recollection of having been
allowed to do this.  "If any widow have children or nephews, let them
learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents; for
that is good and acceptable before God. . . .  But if any provide not
for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel." [5]<p>

But this sermon, delivered from the pulpit of the cross, has a wider
range.  It informs us that our Saviour has a concern for our temporal
as well as for our eternal interests.  Even on the cross, where He was
expiating the sin of the world, He was thinking of the comfort of His
widowed mother.  Let the needy and the deserted take courage from this,
and cast all their care upon Him, for He careth for them.  It is often
an astonishment to see how widows especially are helped through.  When
they are left, with perhaps a number of little children, it seems
incomprehensible how they can get on.  Yet not infrequently their
families turn out better than those where the father has been spared.
One reason is, perhaps, that their children feel from the first that
they must take a share of the responsibility, and this makes men and
women of them.  But the chief reason undoubtedly is that God fulfils
His own promise to be a Father to the fatherless and a Husband to the
widow, and that they have not been forgotten by Him who in the hour of
His absorbing agony remembered Mary.<p>

[1] "Woman, behold thy son . . .  Behold thy mother."<p>

[2] It is not certain whether John xix. 25 describes three women or
four.  Is the second Salome, John's mother?<p>

[3] Chrysostom.<p>

[4] "Woman" may mean sadly (proleptically), "Thou hast no son now."<p>

[5] 1 Tim. v. 6, 8.<p.
