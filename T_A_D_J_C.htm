<P>PREFACE
<P></CENTER></FONT><FONT color=#0000aa face="ArrusBT" size=3><B>Ever since I wrote, in a contracted form, <i>The Life of Jesus Christ</i>,
the desire has slumbered in my mind to describe on a much more extended
scale the closing passages of the Saviour's earthly history; and,
although renewed study has deepened my sense of the impossibility of
doing these scenes full justice, yet the subject has never ceased to
attract me, as being beyond all others impressive and remunerative.<p>
The limits of our Lord's Passion are somewhat indeterminate.
Krummacher begins with the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, Tauler with
the Feet-washing before the Last Supper, and Rambach with Gethsemane;
most end with the Death and Burial; but Grimm, a Roman Catholic, the
latest writer on the subject, means to extend his <i>Leidensgeschichte</i>
to the end of the Forty Days.  Taking the word "passion" in the strict
sense, I have commenced at the point where, by falling into the hands
of His enemies, our Lord was deprived of voluntary activity; and I have
finished with the Burial.  No doubt the same unique greatness belongs
to the scenes of the previous evening; and I should like to write of
Christ among His Friends as I have here written of Him among His Foes;
but for this purpose a volume at least as large as the present one
would be requisite; and the portion here described has an obvious unity
of its own.<p>
The bibliography of the Passion is given with considerable fulness in
<i>Zöckler's  Das Kreuz Christi</i>; but a good many of the books there
enumerated may be said to have been superseded by the monumental work
of Nebe, <i>Die Leidensgeschichte unsers Herrn Hesu Christi</i> (2 vols.,
1881), which, though not a work of genius, is written on so
comprehensive a plan and with such abundance of learning that nothing
could better serve the purpose of anyone who wishes to draw the
skeleton before painting the picture.  Of the numerous Lives of Christ
those by Keim and Edersheim are worthy of special notice in this part
of the history, because of the fulness of information from classical
sources in the one and from Talmudical in the other.  Steinmeyer
(<i>Leidensgeschichte</i>) is valuable on apologetic questions.  On the
Seven Words from the Cross there is an extensive special literature.
Schleiermacher and Tholuck are remarkably good; and there are volumes
by Baring-Gould, Scott Holland and others.<p>
In the sub-title I have called this book a Devotional History, because
the subject is one which has to be studied with the heart as well as
the head.  But I have not on this account written in the declamatory
and interrogatory style common in devotional works.  I have to confess
that some even of the most famous books on the Passion are to me
intolerably tedious, because they are written, so to speak, in oh's and
ah's.  Surely this is not essential to devotion.  The scenes of the
Passion ought, indeed, to stir the depths of the heart; but this
purpose is best attained, not by the narrator displaying his own
emotions, but, as is shown in the incomparable model of the Gospels, by
the faithful exhibition of the facts themselves.<p>

GLASGOW, 1894.
