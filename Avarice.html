 AVARICE<p> I.</center><p> No one who has pondered much on the course of human life 
will be astonished at avarice holding a high place on the roll of the deadly 
sins, for it has played a conspicuous and an evil part in history. The old 
authors who wrote on the Seven Deadly Sins used to assign to each of them a 
number of daughters-that is, of sins which each breeds-and the daughters 
assigned to avarice were numerous and ill-favoured. A large proportion of the 
wrongs and crimes of history has been due to the inordinate greed of gain. 
Indeed, the Bible itself says that 'the love of money is the root of all evil.' 
Many attempts have been made to soften down this statement. Attention has, for 
example, been drawn to the fact that it is not about money the statement is 
made, but about the love of money. Then, it has been pointed out, the correct 
translation may be-'is a root of all evil,' not ' the root.' Evil has many 
roots, and this is one of them. Or, again, the meaning may be that every kind of 
evil at one time or another springs from this root-it may spring from other 
roots here or there, but somewhere it is always springing from the love of 
money. In spite, however, of these ingenious suggestions, I am persuaded, the 
text means what it says. It is a magnificent hyperbole, to denote how widespread 
is the evil which money does-corroding the hearts of men, spoiling their 
happiness, and setting them in conflict with one another. 'Man's inhumanity to 
man makes countless thousands mourn'; but the in- humanity springs, for the most 
part, from the desire of one man to possess that which belongs to another.<p> The 
lust of one country for the soil of another has, thousands of times, let loose 
war and pillage on innocent populations. The powerful have, in every age, under 
the sway of similar motives, plundered the goods and oppressed the persons of 
the weak. The lawful hire of toilers has been kept back by their employers, and 
human law has been too servile to say them nay; and so the rich have filled 
their granaries with the food which ought to have fed the poor, and worn as 
purple and fine linen what ought to have covered the persons of the naked. The 
love of money has begotten the courage of the highwayman ; it has sharpened the 
ingenuity of the thief; it has, many a time, put a knife in the hand of the 
murderer; and for thirty pieces of silver Judas sold his Master.<p> But, besides 
such tragic crimes, the record of which reddens the page of history, what a 
progeny of sordid sins the love of money is bringing forth every day. It teaches 
the merchant to adulterate his goods, the apprentice to put his hand into his 
master's till, the lawyer to lie, the operator on the Stock Exchange to swindle 
his clients. A Latin satirist, twenty centuries ago, charged the Roman fathers 
of his day with saying to their sons, 'Get money; honestly, if you can; but, in 
any case, get money '; and a satirist of our own age alleges that, in modern 
life, the only unpardonable sin is poverty. On every hand men are making haste 
to be rich, and, if they succeed, everything is forgiven them. The gates of the 
highest society swing open to the man who has gold, and he is not asked how he 
has come by it. Over the man who has swindled and failed, society, with upturned 
eyes, pronounces an annihilating judgment; but the adventurer who brings home 
bullion tinged with the blood of slaves is welcomed as an honour to his country 
and sent into Parliament.<p> One of the daughters of avarice which the old writers 
used to mention was gambling; and the need has not gone by for indicating the 
true place to which this vice belongs. The desire to make money is undoubtedly 
at the bottom of the practice-to make money in haste, without giving any 
equivalent for it-and this is its condemnation. But, after it has grown into a 
habit, it becomes a very complex thing. The gambler can hardly tell why he 
follows with such eagerness the events of the green turf and the fortunes of the 
green table. There is a fever in his blood which drives him on, rendering 
ordinary pursuits and ordinary gains stale and making his own heart reckless and 
hardened. A single act of gambling has an innocent look, and the first steps in 
a gambling career are frequently exhilarating; but the atmosphere soon becomes 
grimy, the associations and companionships into which it leads are demoralising, 
and many a time it ends in the dock and the jail.<p><center><p> II.<p></center> Such are the daughters of 
avarice, and the character of the progeny does not say much for that of the 
mother. What the innermost nature of avarice is may be learned from the 
well-known words of Scripture- ' Covetousness, which is idolatry.' Pride, the 
first of the deadly sins, is also a kind of idolatry: it is putting self in the 
place of God. But avarice substitutes for God an even more amazing deity- 
something outside of ourselves, earthly and material. We think with disdain of 
the folly of the heathen, who bend the knee to graven images; but many a man's 
money is his god, and the coins of silver and of gold which he fingers so 
caressingly are in reality images in which his deity is embodied. This may seem 
a figure of rhetoric, but it is the sober truth. For, what is it to have a god? 
It is to have an object to which the heart turns with supreme affection and to 
which the mind looks as a refuge and defence in all the changes and chances of 
time. Are there not, however, those who feel the money they possess to be a far 
safer assurance against possible calamity than faith or prayer, and who would 
feel the loss of the opportunities of worshipping God afforded by the Sabbath 
and the sanctuary a far less sensible calamity than the loss of their money?<p> 
This unconscious idolatry sits deep in many hearts in the form of what our Lord 
called 'carefulness'-that is, the continual indulgence of carking care, a 
lifelong dread of poverty, a sense that, not having money, they have no 
protection and no hope. For avarice is not confined to those who are wealthy: 
the poor may be equally the victims of it. Excessive elation in the possession 
of money and excessive depression on account of the absence of it are, in fact, 
at bottom the same feeling; and the feeling is, that money is the true divinity, 
beside which there is no other. It is no unusual thing to hear the avarice of 
the rich denounced in a spirit of the most sordid greed, the language betraying 
the belief that money can do everything and making it patent to the critical 
hearer that the orators, if they possessed money, would be as absorbed in it and 
as forgetful of the claims of others as those they denounce. The man who is 
loudest in denouncing tyrants often becomes a tyrant himself, when he gets the 
chance; and those who cry out for equality are sometimes the first, when they 
have obtained the upper hand, to shake off the claims of fraternity. The worship 
of money is not a religion, which favours the brotherhood of man.<p><center> III.</Center><p> Deep 
students of human nature have spoken of avarice as incurable. Thus Dante, 
personifying it, says: -<p><center> Accurst be thou, inveterate wolf, whose gorge ingluts 
more prey Than every beast beside, yet is not filled, So bottomless thy maw.</center><p> 
Many a man, at the beginning of his career, dreams of no greater fortune than a 
few hundreds; but, if he is successful, that which was once the limit of his 
ambition soon becomes only the starting-point. He may have been humble, and 
prayerful and thankful for his early successes; but as his money carries him 
further and further away from the habits and associations of his youth, his 
heart hardens, and his faith is transferred from God to Mammon; he becomes proud 
of himself and contemptuous of his fellow-men. Thus the very goodness of God 
makes him forgetful of his Maker. As long as he was little, he recognised the 
hand from which his mercies were received, but-sad perversion-when mercies are 
multiplied, the Giver is forgotten.<p> Avarice is distinctively a sin of the old; 
and it is this, which makes the cure of it so hopeless. As other sources of 
happiness fail, this one seems to grow more substantial; and the flattery which 
the dependent are too apt to bestow on those from whom they have expectations 
produces by degrees a sense of omnipotence. On the canvas of the painter a miser 
is usually represented as an old man clutching with thin and bony fingers a bag 
of gold. But this is a fancy picture. The real danger, which has to be resisted 
by old and young alike, is the tendency to believe that, if we have money to 
trust in, we can dispense with both the blessing of God and the sympathy of man.<p>
<center> 
IV.</center><p>I have not hesitated to paint this deadly sin in its true colours, but I 
should feel that I had rendered to my readers a very indifferent service, if I 
merely left on their minds the impression that money is an enemy of which they 
must beware. Everyone knows better, and nothing tends more to associate the 
pulpit with unreality than sermons, which leave impressions of this kind. 
Everyone knows, on the contrary, that money is a good thing; most men are giving 
the sweat of their brow and the force of their brain for it; they are well aware 
that without it they cannot set up a home and fill it with refinement; families 
and countries which are exercising the virtues of industry, honesty and sobriety 
tend to grow rich ; and art, science and even religion are, in many ways, 
dependent on money. The fact is, young men are in quite as much danger of 
putting too little value on money as too much. They often fling it away with 
both hands, to their own injury and that of others. Prodigality is nearly as 
much the besetting sin of youth as avarice is the besetting sin of age; but 
virtue lies between the extremes, and its name is liberality.<p> To be forearmed 
against avarice we require to have three convictions sunk deeply in our minds. <p>
The first is that there are better things than money. Good health is better; a 
cultivated intelligence is better; a sympathetic heart is better; a clear 
conscience is better. With these it is possible to be happy without money; but 
without these the happiness which money gives is deceitful. Not only, however, 
must these be prized, but so diligently acquired as to prove that their 
possessor knows he cannot do without them. A cultivated mind, for example, that 
knows something of the best thoughts of the best thinkers of the past, or an 
active sympathy with the wants and aspirations of mankind, is not obtained by 
merely wishing, but by working honestly and feeling deeply; only, when it is 
once got, it cannot be parted with, for it is felt to be a possession beyond all 
price. I know a public man in a great position who was approached, when the 
election was hanging in the balance, by the representatives of a party in the 
electing body which wished him to make a promise to them which would have 
secured their votes, but his answer was-' Gentlemen, there are some things in 
this world I can do without, and one of these is this office for which I have 
been named; but there are some things I cannot do without, and one of these is 
my honour-good day, gentlemen,' and he bowed them to the door. This is the 
attitude we should take up to the temptations of avarice. There are some things 
we can do without, and one of these is wealth; but there are some things we 
cannot do without, such as a clean conscience and a useful life; and, if we must 
choose between money and these, we forego the money.<p> A second conviction, to be 
en-graven still more deeply on the mind which would defend itself from the 
invasions of the sin of avarice is, that money is not an end in itself, but only 
a means to an end. It will tyrannize over us if it is allowed, but we tyrannize 
over it, and prove ourselves its masters, when we compel it to subserve the ends 
which we have freely chosen as our own, and which our judgment and conscience 
approve.<p> When anyone has much wealth, we are wont to call him 'a man of means.' 
But not infrequently the phrase is a misnomer; because means imply ends to which 
they are devoted, and many a wealthy man has no such ends. He does not know why 
he makes money; he is like a horse turning a mill, accustomed to the monotonous 
round; he is the slave of money, which claims all his thoughts and all his 
energy. Yet the phrase ' a man of means ' conveys the hint that money can be 
used in promoting rational and useful ends, and this is true. People often 
speculate on what they would do with money if they had an immense amount of it. 
Such musings may not be amiss, but they are mere illusions, unless we are 
devoting to the same ends such means, as we now happen to possess. David 
Livingstone, before he had thought of being a missionary, devoted to foreign 
missions all his wages as a patternmaker, except so much as was required for his 
frugal personal wants, and there have not been wanting in recent times those who 
have carried on large and flourishing businesses the profits of which they have 
devoted to some favourite scheme of benevolence.<p> One wonders that this should 
not be commoner. But multitudes who have never felt called upon to sacrifice all 
their income in this way give liberally of their earnings to causes which lie 
near their hearts, and they experience a profound satisfaction in so doing, 
because they feel that they are making their money serve their life-aims, and 
they are keeping themselves free from enslavement to it. I remember hearing a 
friend of my own tell of the effect on himself of his first givings to the 
schemes of his Church. He was not at the time earning much, and what he gave 
cost a real effort and sacrifice; but he felt that he had now something to work 
for; this heightened his consciousness as a man and a Christian: it made him 
also look so carefully after his money that, he maintained, he was a gainer, 
even pecuniarily, in the long-run.<p> Giving is usually spoken of as if it were the 
wringing of unwilling drops out of flinty hearts; but there is a remarkable 
verse in the account of the gifts offered in David's time for the temple which 
Solomon subsequently built-' Then the people rejoiced for that they offered 
willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord, and 
David the king also rejoiced with great joy.' There is great joy in giving, when 
it is not forced and indiscriminate, but willing and intelligent-that is, when 
we give to causes with which we are well acquainted and for which we cherish 
enthusiasm. Ought it not to put new energy into a man's fingers and help him to 
sing as be toils, when he reflects that he is earning money to assist the cause 
for which the Saviour died?<p> The third principle about money deserving to be 
inscribed on the mind which would escape the bondage of avarice is, that it 
cannot be kept for ever.<p> 'Lay not up for yourselves,' said the Teacher of 
teachers, in the Sermon on the Mount, ' treasures upon earth, where moth and 
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for 
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and 
where thieves do not break through nor steal; for where your treasure is, there 
will your heart be also.' There are those who mock at such teaching, declaring 
the idea of a treasure in heaven to be merely an illusion by which the poor are 
blinded to the treasure, which is their due on earth. A paradise above the skies 
is only an invention of priests to cheat men out of the paradise they ought to 
seek here below. If this be so, how sad it is that the earthly paradise lasts so 
short a time even for those who attain it.<p> The existence of heaven may be 
doubted, but there is no denying the reality of death. However much a man may 
have amassed, he has in a moment to leave it all and fare forth into the 
unknown, naked as he came from his mother's womb. What has he, then, if there is 
no Saviour to meet him on the frontier of the other world and conduct him safely 
to the many mansions? Is he not poor indeed? But, if a man has realised within 
himself a virtuous and holy character, this is a possession over which time has 
no power, it is incorporated with his very existence, and the owner carries it 
with him wherever he goes-ay, even across the bourne of death. He who has spent 
his life in doing good, making to himself friends of the mammon of 
unrighteousness, will be met at the gates of heaven by grateful hearts, which 
have gone before and will welcome him into everlasting habitations. It may be 
said, that the avaricious man has at least the satisfaction of leaving his money 
to his heir. But this is a mixed satisfaction; for he does not know whether his 
heir will be a wise man or a fool, whether he will keep what he has inherited or 
squander it. The influence, on the contrary, of a benevolent and useful life 
goes on after death and reproduces itself in those whom it awakens to aspiration 
and imitation.<p> Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.<p>
